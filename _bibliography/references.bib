It allows the impact of players’ interactions, rather than players’ contributions to inequality, to be taken into consideration. These innovative approaches are especially suited for the study of income inequality when the income has a hierarchical structure: the income is composed of several primary sources, with the particularity that each of them is also composed of secondary sources. We revisit the Shapley–Owen value that quantiﬁes the importance of each of these secondary sources in the overall income inequality. Our main contribution is to decompose this importance into two parts: the pure marginal contribution of the considered source and a weighted sum of pairwise interactions. We then provide an axiomatic characterization of each additive interaction decomposable (AID) coalitional value considered in this paper. We give an application of these decompositions in the context of inequality theory.},

Therefore, the distribution network operators consider billing consumers behind a common transformer in the function of their peak demand and leave it to the consumers to manage their collective costs. This management problem is, however, not trivial. In this paper, we consider a multi-agent residential smart grid system, where each agent has local renewable energy production and energy storage, and all agents are connected to a local transformer. The objective is to develop an optimal policy that minimizes the economic cost consisting of both the spot-market cost for each consumer and their collective peakpower cost. We propose to use a parametric Model Predictive Control (MPC)-scheme to approximate the optimal policy. The optimality of this policy is limited by its ﬁnite horizon and inaccurate forecasts of the local power production-consumption. A Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) method is deployed to adjust the MPC parameters and improve the policy. Our simulations show that the proposed MPC-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method can effectively decrease the long-term economic cost for this smart grid problem.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an Energy Management (EM) strategy for residential microgrid systems using Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Shapley value. We construct a typical residential microgrid system that considers fluctuating spot-market prices, highly uncertain user demand and renewable generation, and collective peak power penalties. To optimize the benefits for all residential prosumers, the EM problem is formulated as a Cooperative Coalition Game (CCG). The objective is to first find an energy trading policy that reduces the collective economic cost (including spot-market cost and peakpower cost) of the residential coalition, and then to distribute the profits obtained through cooperation to all residents. An MPC-based RL approach, which compensates for the shortcomings of MPC and RL and benefits from the advantages of both, is proposed to reduce the monthly collective cost despite the system uncertainties. To determine the amount of monthly electricity bill each resident should pay, we transfer the cost distribution problem into a profit distribution problem. Then, the Shapley value approach is applied to equitably distribute the profits (i.e., cost savings) gained through cooperation to all residents based on the weighted average of their respective marginal contributions. Finally, simulations are performed on a three-household microgrid system located in Oslo, Norway, to validate the proposed strategy, where a real-world dataset of April 2020 is used. Simulation results show that the proposed MPC-based RL approach could effectively reduce the long-term economic cost by about 17.5\%, and the Shapley value method provides a solution for allocating the collective bills fairly.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RES) generating units such as wind power and photovoltaic (PV) units can be aggregated with controllable loads as virtual power plants (VPPs) to jointly participate in energy and regulation markets for extra market revenue. However, the uncertainty of RES limits the market performance of the VPP, which can be solved by energy storage. Due to the flexibility of the energy storage sharing mode, a two-part price-based leasing mechanism of shared energy storage (SES) considering market prices and battery degrada­ tion is proposed to provide the short-term use rights of energy storage for the VPP in a new pattern. Then, an SESassisted real-time output cooperation scheme for the VPP in joint energy and regulation markets is designed to improve the VPP market performance and a joint optimal market bidding model of the VPP with the assistance of the SES is developed to maximize the expected daily profit. Moreover, a profit allocation approach for the SESassisted VPP based on the improved Shapley value method and the minimizing deviation algorithm (ISV-MDA) is proposed to reflect the real contributions and balance the interests of its participants. Simulations based on data from PJM and NREL Dataset illustrate that RES can significantly improve their profits by participating in the VPP to jointly lease the use rights of SES and participate in joint energy and regulation markets through the coop­ eration and bidding strategies. In addition, the proposed profit allocation method is more reasonable and more targeted for allocating the cooperation profit than the cooperative game-based methods.},

	abstract = {Given the widespread adoption of renewable generation, storage and new loads like electric vehicle charging, there has been a growing effort to enhance local energy resilience, particularly at the community level. This has led to increasing interest in the development of local or community energy projects, in which individual prosumers are able to generate, store and trade energy within the community — enabling a shift in market power from large utility companies to individual prosumers. Such schemes often involve a group of consumers investing in community-owned asset such as community-owned wind turbines or shared battery storage. Yet, developing methods to enable efficient control and fair sharing of jointly-owned assets is a key open question, of both research and practical importance. In this paper, we provide a method inspired from game theory concepts to fairly redistribute the benefits from community owned energy-assets such as community wind turbines and storage. We propose a heuristic-based battery control algorithm for maximization of behind-themeter self-consumption, which considers the effect of battery life degradation. Using real consumption and production data to model a community of two hundred households, we assess and compare technical and economic benefits of investment in individually-owned or community-owned assets such as chemical storage. We show that battery storage simple pay-back period can be considerably reduced by sharing the asset within a community. Finally, we compare several redistribution and benefit allocation schemes for community-owned assets, and show that the proposed scheme based on principles from cooperative game theory achieves the fairest redistribution.},

The optimization model considers the legal constraints imposed to feed the surplus autogenerated electricity into the grid at a regulated feed-in tariff.

This increased demand for communication causes heavy utilization of the radio spectrum to improve ubiquitous computing services.

The problem addressed by Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) architecture has attracted research and industrial community to enhance the real-time communication systems. Although CRN based real-time communication systems suffer from resource allocation, spectrum sensing, and power consumption issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for resource allocation and sharing based on cooperative game theory, and cooperative node selection ensures maximized payoff. The proposed method optimizes the overhead, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Further, energy consumption and resource allocation issues transformed into an optimization problem. A backtracking search algorithm is applied to reduce the computation complexity and to find the optimal solution for resource utilization.

At the Level I, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum power of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the power grid, to maximize the profits. Further, the fuzzy logic algorithm is applied to model the intermittent nature of the renewable sources and implement load demand in the power grid. At the Level II, DERs are classified into two different fuzzy logic groups to secure the fairness between every participant. Finally, at the Level III, the DERs in each group are combined each other by cooperative game theory-based algorithms to increase the coalition profits.

We formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to ﬁnd the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6\%) of the total coalition constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus. The proposed model and results nicely ﬁt systems operated by autonomous vehicles.},

However, no guidance has been provided on how SC members could collaborate on their sustainability development efforts to achieve the intended economic performance. This study addressed this research gap by proposing different contractual governances, based on a game-theoretic approach, for both manufacturer and retailer to better engage in JSD. Speciﬁcally, multiple JSD contractual arrangements regarding proﬁt and associated cost sharing between manufacturers and retailers were deﬁned and evaluated. Our analyses show that the manufacturer behaves opportunistically when the impact of a retailer’s effort on consumer demand is low. In other words, the retailer increases its sustainability effort, but not the manufacturer. However, such opportunistic behavior can be removed under a revenue sharing arrangement. That is, the manufacturer becomes cooperative with the retailer, and both retailer and manufacturer increase their JSD efforts. Several numerical experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of various revenue sharing arrangements (no sharing, partial proﬁt sharing, and total proﬁt sharing) in devising and implementing a mutually beneﬁcial JSD program. Accordingly, several guidelines for the SC JSD implementation are provided.},

	abstract = {China now faces severe air pollution problems while consuming a huge quantity of coal. At present, due to the emission charges and the emissions trading policy failed to effectively prompt enterprises to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Therefore, improving air quality through regional negotiations and cooperation may be feasible and effective. In this study, which was based on game theory, a transboundary air pollution model was established to conduct an empirical study on the cost-effectiveness of cooperative SO2 reduction in three cities of Hunan province in China. Four gain allocation mechanisms, i.e., the nucleolus, Nash-Harsanyi allocation solution, Shapley value and Separable Cost Remaining Beneﬁt (SCRB) principle, were employed to allocate the gains of cooperation, and the fairness and stability of the different allocation mechanisms were also analyzed. The results show that if a gain-sharing mechanism can reasonably allocate the gain from full cooperation, it is then feasible and effective for the three cities to fully cooperate to reduce SO2 emissions. Among the four gain allocation methods investigated in this empirical study, the stabilities of gain allocation for full cooperation using SCRB principle and Nash-Harsanyi allocation method were higher than those using the other two allocation methods. The results provide clear empirical evidence that regional gain allocation may affect the sustainability of cooperation. Therefore, although it was desirable to reduce SO2 emissions through cooperation, the long-term sustainability of cooperation should be taken into account in developing relevant policies.},

	abstract = {The motivation to protect environment and reduce CO2 emissions has resulted in increase in number of electric vehicle (EV) users. However, the rising number of EVs leads to increasing electricity demands and aggravates the burden on existing energy distribution systems. Therefore, the distributed energy systems, where consumers can also sell their surplus energy are required to overcome the potential challenges of high energy demands predicted in future. Furthermore, the consumers are now inclined towards buying energy from a renewable source to reduce environmental damage. Therefore, the sellers willing to contribute towards environmental sustainability also need to be encouraged to generate energy at a small scale through renewable sources and offer them at cheap prices. This paper proposes an energy trading system where both EVs and immobile users, such as houses and buildings, act as prosumers. They can buy or sell energy for both monetary incentives as well as for altruistic aim of environmental sustainability. A 5Genabled aggregator is proposed to manage the energy trading system through blockchain and smart contracts for maintaining security and immutability in transactions and verify energy sources. Stackelberg non-cooperative and cooperative games are formulated to strategize incentives of prosumers reflecting both altruism and monetary incentives. Complexity analysis and probabilistic calculations are performed to theoretically analyze the proposed system. Simulation results show more than 90\% and 60\% successful energy transactions when only seller is EV and when both buyers and sellers are EVs, respectively.},

This study proposes a crowdshipping model that consists of three stakeholders (the owner of a crowdshipping platform, crowdshippers and parcel providers) and with various incentives aims to maximise the proﬁtability of the platform and the compensation of crowdshippers, the quality of delivery, and to minimise environmental externalities. A two-level leader–follower game and the concept of Shapley value, from cooperative ﬂow games at the follower level, are used to deﬁne the optimal strategy that provides sustainable delivery with a good balance between costs and proﬁts. The game behaviour was explained on a crowdshipping platform provider (leader) and two coalitions: individual crowdshippers and parcel logistics providers. The aim of the example is to explain the strategy of promoting environmentally friendly parcel delivery. The results show satisfactory economic, social and environmental performance.},

            This paper proposes a central energy management system (EMS) in smart buildings. It is based on the coalition method for optimal energy sharing between smart buildings. Game theory is applied to obtain an optimal allocation of the building's surplus energy on the deficient energy buildings using the Shapley value, which enables the unequal energy distribution based on the energy demand. The main objective is reducing energy waste while preserving the generation/demand balance. The fog platform with memory storage is applied, which handles all the measured data from the smart buildings through Wi-Fi-based communication protocol and performs the EMS program. The smart meter links the smart buildings with the fog-based EMS central unit. Two scenarios are implemented based on the difference between total deficient and surplus energy. Coalition game theory is applied for optimal surplus energy allocation on deficient buildings when the total energy surplus is lower than the total energy deficient. Also, there is a one-to-one relationship between the surplus and deficient building; if the surplus energy is larger than the deficit, the extra surplus energy is stored for further usage. The proposed EMS is applied and tested using a smart city with 10 buildings in the MATLAB program. A comparison between the result obtained with and without applying the proposed method is performed. The performance of the fog platform is introduced based on the run and delay time and the memory size usage. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in a smart building.},

The methodology combines cooperative game theory with a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model allowing us to endogenize testing of stability of the global coalition and to include macroeconomic effects. Global cooperation is found to be stable only under mean or pessimistic assumptions about the development of key low-carbon power technologies and when damage is severe. If the technological development is favorable or climate damage is not severe, the gains from global cooperation are not sufficient to compensate for mitigation costs, because a nonglobal coalition of willing countries can then achieve emission reductions close to the global optimum. Finally, our findings support establishing nonglobal `climate clubs' to overcome the lack of global cooperation in international climate policy.},

	abstract = {CO2 emissions reduction is a global challenge while the associated cost pressure presents a crucial issue. Within a country, each region, with different levels of abatement cost, may play different roles to achieve the national target of CO2 emissions reduction. Such heterogeneity could play a role in the cost efficiency of national CO2 emissions reduction, i.e. the minimum total abatement cost across the entire country. Previous models pre­ dominately focus on minimizing the total abatement cost, while the allocation of cooperative benefits is largely overlooked. We constructed a combined regional optimization and game model, i.e., the cooperative emission reduction model. The aim is to achieve the national carbon reduction target while reducing CO2 emissions at a minimum cost through inter-regional cooperation. In order to achieve cooperation, it is imperative to ensure that every participating region can benefit from cooperation. This study developed a cooperative emission reduction model based on the Shapley value method of game theory to determine the mechanism to distribute cooperation benefits amongst participating regions in fairness. Compared to the total costs before applying this model, 17.04 \% {\textasciitilde} 33.62 \% and 19.59 \% {\textasciitilde} 24.62 \% total CO2 abatement costs of China can be saved in 2025 and 2030, respectively. This method can be employed in other countries to assist policymakers to establish an appropriate goal for CO2 emission reduction, and formulate a compensation mechanism to promote inter-regional cooper­ ation with fairness and minimum cost.},

Agents may act cooperatively, building coalitions and acting according to the interest of the coalition, or they make their choices taking care of their individual interest only. We consider two kinds of countries: the ﬁrst type are industrially advanced, namely developed countries, while the second type are the less developed, namely developing countries. About environmental preservation, the developed countries are characterized by a higher measure of the environmental awareness than developing ones. We provide a new graphic way to visualise results about stable coalitions of different sizes taking into account several environmental awareness values. Moreover, we present a handy Maple algorithm to determine both the optimal costs for each country and the coalitions’ stability with an arbitrary number of developed and developing countries. Finally, we introduce an ex-post transfer scheme in order to expand a generic coalition to the grand coalition which reaches the greatest abatement level and the lowest aggregate costs.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the free rider problem that exists in the joint effort to mitigate climate change. There is a need to develop a model that is stable and that provides evidence of an objective burden sharing rule so that the environmental agreement is more acceptable. This study approaches this problem via a cooperative game at the global level to make International Environmental Agreements (IEA) more stable. For this purpose, we apply the Shapley value transfer mechanism and find that under the commitment scenario, some regions attain the maximum benefits by joining the coalition. Shapley value transfer improves the coalition size and increases the global benefits at a certain level of abatement under perfect cooperation. Imperfect cooperation leads to lower levels of global benefits. Our findings offer new implications on how to improve the international cooperation for climate change. Commitments by major regions could activate the IEA (e.g., Paris agreement) efficiently. For the maximum global response to climate change, the national governments must reformulate and implement policies to meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The results of this study also help the national governments to set their implementation priorities to implement the Paris Accord at global level.},

	abstract = {Environmental economics deals with the optimal allocation of production factors and correcting market failure in protecting the environment. Market failure occurs because of externalities, common property resources, and public goods. Environmental policy instruments include direct regulation, taxes/subsidies, tradable permits, deposit systems, voluntary agreements, and persuasion. Environmental policies usually focus on one pollutant or environmental issue but may have substantial impacts on other emissions and environmental problems. Neglecting these impacts will result in suboptimal policies. We present an integrated optimisation model for determining cost-effective strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions of several pollutants from several sources, allowing for interrelations between sources and abatement options. Our integrated approach in regard to acidifying compounds and greenhouse gases will be able to provide cost-effective policy options that will result in lower overall abatement costs. This paper shows that efficient emission reduction can be calculated, but we argue that, for transboundary air pollution and climate change, it is difficult to implement the socially optimal solution because strong incentives exist for “freeriding”. In order to implement efficient policies, international environmental agreements like the Gothenburg or the Kyoto Protocol are necessary to establish stable coalitions. The stability of these agreements depends on the distribution of costs and benefits over countries and on the redistribution of the gains of cooperation.},

The externality and timing effects are countervailing forces on abatement levels of greenhouse gases. The Paradox of Cooperation in the three-stage Stackelberg game is explained by showing that when the gains to cooperation are small the timing effect dominates the externality effect and large coalitions are stable. The timing effect has the greatest impact when the high benefit nations have low abatement cost. The cost-effectiveness effect arises from asymmetry and generates the need for an agreement with transfers. The cost-effectiveness effect is largest when the high benefit nations are high cost. This creates a larger difference in the marginal abatement cost of the last unit of abatement in the absence of an agreement. Numerical examples illustrate how the parameters and effects interact to result in outcomes ranging from no to full participation.},

We ﬁrst explain why the use of a technology oriented model may add value to the analysis of global GHG strategies. Based on the empirical ﬁnding of linear cumulative climate damages, the computation of Nash equilibrium can be reduced to solving a series of 15 independent linear programs, one per region. Moreover, assuming interregional transfers to share the global surplus of cooperation, our work adopts the point of view of dynamic partial equilibrium computation coupled with cooperative game-theoretic principles. The results illustrate how the non-cooperative strategy is closer to the base case than to the cooperative strategy, and the amount of side-payments sufﬁcient to guarantee the stability of the cooperative strategy are calculated with four different rules. The internal (in)stability of farsighted coalitions without transfers (non-cooperation) is also analyzed. The current project appears to be the ﬁrst one of the sort using a large and detailed technology explicit model such as MARKAL.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the evaluation of energy, economic and environmental efﬁciency, employing the data envelopment analysis models, has been a hot topic in academe. When choosing models, people always expect to improve desirable outputs, while reducing undesirable outputs at the same time (e.g. when using a directional distance function model). However, directional distance function models may lead to biased estimations due to different directions given to different units. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose another non-radial efﬁciency evaluation model based on previous literature, which can also improve desirable outputs and reduce undesirable outputs. Then we employ this model to analyse the economic efﬁciency and CO2 emissions efﬁciency of the Asia Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation (APEC) members. Meanwhile, we also measure the efﬁciency change by using the Luenberger index, and analyse the reasons for efﬁciency changes from the perspectives of technical efﬁciency, and technical, changes. The results indicate that most countries have an extremely high economic efﬁciency, but relatively low CO2 emissions efﬁciency and integrated efﬁciency except for the United States, Japan, and Singapore. According to the Luenberger index, we ﬁnd an increase in integrated efﬁciency and CO2 emissions efﬁciency for most members from 2001 to 2010; however, technical progress is the main contributor. Technical efﬁciency exhibits a downward trend for most members.},

The proposed framework is applied to four large CO2 emitting manufacturing sectors (CHEMICAL, METAL, MINERAL, and PAPER sectors) between 2008 and 2014. From the potential estimation, the results suggest that signiﬁcant CO2 reduction potentials exist in all four of these manufacturing sectors across 26 countries in 2014: 1139Mt-CO2, 1096Mt-CO2, 171Mt-CO2, and 322Mt-CO2, respectively. The decomposition results show that carbon factor and energy intensity change decrease the CO2 reduction potential (i.e., desirable effect), whereas energy saving potential ratio increases the potential (i.e., undesirable effect) during the study period. The efﬁciency improvement priority for CO2 mitigation is discussed from two perspectives: the size of the potential and the transition of each contributory factor to the potential over time.},
