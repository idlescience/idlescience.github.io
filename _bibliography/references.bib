An Introduction to Graph Neural Networks: Models and Applications

Got it now: "Graph Neural Networks (GNN) are a general class of networks that work over graphs. By representing a problem as a graph — encoding the information of individual elements as nodes and their relationships as edges — GNNs learn to capture patterns within the graph. These networks have been successfully used in applications such as chemistry and program analysis. In this introductory talk, I will do a deep dive in the neural message-passing GNNs, and show how to create a simple GNN implementation. Finally, I will illustrate how GNNs have been used in applications.

	abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular ﬁngerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difﬁcult to train for a ﬁxed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	abstract = {News recommendation is an important technique for personalized news service. Compared with product and movie recommendations which have been comprehensively studied, the research on news recommendation is much more limited, mainly due to the lack of a high-quality benchmark dataset. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset named MIND for news recommendation. Constructed from the user click logs of Microsoft News, MIND contains 1 million users and more than 160k English news articles, each of which has rich textual content such as title, abstract and body. We demonstrate MIND a good testbed for news recommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art news recommendation methods which are originally developed on different proprietary datasets. Our results show the performance of news recommendation highly relies on the quality of news content understanding and user interest modeling. Many natural language processing techniques such as effective text representation methods and pre-trained language models can effectively improve the performance of news recommendation. The MIND dataset will be available at https://msnews.github.io.},

	abstract = {It is necessary to understand the content of articles and user preferences to make effective news recommendations. While ID-based methods, such as collaborative filtering and low-rank factorization, are well known for making recommendations, they are not suitable for news recommendations because candidate articles expire quickly and are replaced with new ones within short spans of time. Word-based methods, which are often used in information retrieval settings, are good candidates in terms of system performance but have issues such as their ability to cope with synonyms and orthographical variants and define "queries" from users' historical activities. This paper proposes an embedding-based method to use distributed representations in a three step end-to-end manner: (i) start with distributed representations of articles based on a variant of a denoising autoencoder, (ii) generate user representations by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with browsing histories as input sequences, and (iii) match and list articles for users based on inner-product operations by taking system performance into consideration. The proposed method performed well in an experimental offline evaluation using past access data on Yahoo! JAPAN's homepage. We implemented it on our actual news distribution system based on these experimental results and compared its online performance with a method that was conventionally incorporated into the system. As a result, the click-through rate (CTR) improved by 23\% and the total duration improved by 10\%, compared with the conventionally incorporated method. Services that incorporated the method we propose are already open to all users and provide recommendations to over ten million individual users per day who make billions of accesses per month.},

The results show that the in-degree of famous entities does not fit to power-law distribution. Conversely, the maximum number of famous followees in one category for each user shows power-law property. To our best knowledge, there is no research work on this topic with human-chosen famous entity dataset in real life.

	abstract = {News and social media now play a synergistic role and neither domain can be grasped in isolation. On one hand, platforms such as Twitter have taken a central role in the dissemination and consumption of news. On the other hand, news editors rely on social media for following their audience’s attention and for crowd-sourcing news stories. Twitter hashtags function as a key connection between Twitter crowds and the news media, by naturally naming and contextualizing stories, grouping the discussion of news and marking topic trends. In this work, we propose Hashtagger+, an efﬁcient learning-to-rank framework for merging news and social streams in real-time, by recommending Twitter hashtags to news articles. We provide an extensive study of different approaches for streaming hashtag recommendation, and show that pointwise learning-to-rank is more effective than multi-class classiﬁcation as well as more complex learning-to-rank approaches. We improve the efﬁciency and coverage of a state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation model by proposing new techniques for data collection and feature computation. In our comprehensive evaluation on real-data, we show that we drastically outperform the accuracy and efﬁciency of prior methods. Our prototype system delivers recommendations in under 1 minute, with a Precision@1 of 94 percent and article coverage of 80 percent. This is an order of magnitude faster than prior approaches, and brings improvements of 5 percent in precision and 20 percent in coverage. By effectively linking the news stream to the social stream via the recommended hashtags, we open the door to solving many challenging problems related to story detection and tracking. To showcase this potential, we present an application of our recommendations to automated news story tracking via social tags. Our recommendation framework is implemented in a real-time Web system available from insight4news.ucd.ie.},

Similar to actual ripples propagating on the water, RippleNet stimulates the propagation of user preferences over the set of knowledge entities by automatically and iteratively extending a user’s potential interests along links in the knowledge graph. The multiple "ripples" activated by a user’s historically clicked items are thus superposed to form the preference distribution of the user with respect to a candidate item, which could be used for predicting the final clicking probability. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that RippleNet achieves substantial gains in a variety of scenarios, including movie, book and news recommendation, over several state-of-the-art baselines.},

MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by cross\&compress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that cross\&compress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-theart baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse.},

	abstract = {Szegedy’s quantum walk is a quantization of a classical random walk or Markov chain, where the walk occurs on the edges of the bipartite double cover of the original graph. To search, one can simply quantize a Markov chain with absorbing vertices. Recently, Santos proposed two alternative search algorithms that instead utilize the sign-ﬂip oracle in Grover’s algorithm rather than absorbing vertices. In this paper, we show that these two algorithms are exactly equivalent to two algorithms involving coined quantum walks, which are walks on the vertices of the original graph with an internal degree of freedom. The ﬁrst scheme is equivalent to a coined quantum walk with one walk-step per query of Grover’s oracle, and the second is equivalent to a coined quantum walk with two walk-steps per query of Grover’s oracle. These equivalences lie outside the previously known equivalence of Szegedy’s quantum walk with absorbing vertices and the coined quantum walk with the negative identity operator as the coin for marked vertices, whose precise relationships we also investigate.},

However, the model is always incomplete with signiﬁcant parameter errors and such P2P communication system is hard to maintain. In this article, we propose an online multi-agent reinforcement learning and decentralized control framework (OLDC) for VVC. In this framework, the VVC problem is formulated as a constrained Markov game and we propose a novel multi-agent constrained soft actor-critic (MACSAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. MACSAC is used to train the control agents online, so the accurate ADN model is no longer needed. Then, the trained agents can realize decentralized optimization using local measurements without real-time P2P communication. The OLDC with MACSAC has shown extraordinary ﬂexibility, efﬁciency and robustness to various computing and communication conditions. Numerical simulations on IEEE test cases not only demonstrate that the proposed MACSAC outperforms the state-of-art learning algorithms, but also support the superiority of our OLDC framework in the online application.},

	abstract = {The intelligent control of the traffic signal is critical to the optimization of transportation systems. To achieve global optimal traffic efficiency in large-scale road networks, recent works have focused on coordination among intersections, which have shown promising results. However, existing studies paid more attention to observations sharing among intersections (both explicit and implicit) and did not care about the consequences after decisions. In this paper, we design a multi-agent coordination framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning method for traffic signal control, defined as 𝛾-Reward that includes both original 𝛾-Reward and 𝛾Attention-Reward. Specifically, we propose the Spatial Differentiation method for coordination which uses the temporal–spatial information in the replay buffer to amend the reward of each action. A concise theoretical analysis that proves the proposed model can converge to Nash equilibrium is given. By extending the idea of Markov Chain to the dimension of space–time, this truly decentralized coordination mechanism replaces the graph attention method and realizes the decoupling of the road network, which is more scalable and more in line with practice. The simulation results show that the proposed model remains a state-of-the-art performance even not use a centralized setting. Code is available in https://github.com/Skylark0924/Gamma\_Reward.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to enable a team of quadrotors to learn how to accurately track a desired trajectory while holding a given formation. We solve this problem in a distributed manner, where each vehicle has only access to the information of its neighbors. The desired trajectory is only available to one (or few) vehicle(s). We present a distributed iterative learning control (ILC) approach where each vehicle learns from the experience of its own and its neighbors’ previous task repetitions and adapts its feedforward input to improve performance. Existing algorithms are extended in theory to make them more applicable to real-world experiments. In particular, we prove convergence of the learning scheme for any linear, causal learning function with gains chosen according to a simple scalar condition. Previous proofs were restricted to a speciﬁc learning function, which only depends on the tracking error derivative (D-type ILC). This extension provides more degrees of freedom in the ILC design and, as a result, better performance can be achieved. We also show that stability is not affected by a linear dynamic coupling between neighbors. This allows the use of an additional consensus feedback controller to compensate for non-repetitive disturbances. Possible robustness extensions for the ILC algorithm are discussed, the so-called Q-ﬁlter and a Kalman ﬁlter for disturbance estimation. Finally, this is the ﬁrst work to show distributed ILC in experiment. With a team of two quadrotors, the practical applicability of the proposed distributed multi-agent ILC approach is attested and the beneﬁts of the theoretic extension are analyzed. In a second experimental setup with a team of four quadrotors, we evaluate the impact of different communication graph structures on the learning performance. The results indicate, that there is a trade-off between fast learning convergence and formation synchronicity, especially during the ﬁrst iterations.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to propose a self-triggered consensus control scheme for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems with sensor saturation. Because of the existence of unknown nonlinear dynamics, this study borrows the approximation capability of neural networks to design the consensus control protocol. This paper adopts neural network to approximate the ideal controller, instead of using the combination of neural network and adaptive method to approximate the unknown system dynamics. Thus, the extended approximation property of neural network for event-based sampling can be beneﬁcially introduced. Moreover, the designed controller only updates at discrete time, which enables that the system can be modeled as a hybrid system with impulsive dynamics. Thus, the stability theory of impulsive systems can be used to analyze the convergence of the system. It should be noted that this is the ﬁrst time to propose an effective event-triggered consensus control algorithm based on neural network. Furthermore, this paper also considers a frequently encountered phenomenon of sensor saturation. The convex hull method is adopted to deal with sensor saturation problem, instead of the widely used sector condition method. Finally, the performance of the proposed neural-network based self-triggered consensus control algorithm is demonstrated by the numerical examples.},

Compared with the traditional problem that all UAVs took off from just one base, this paper is to address reconnaissance missions, which must be done in partnership among multiple UAVs in different bases. To improve missions’ reliability, residence time in effective detection of enemy radars should be mitigated under the premise of missions completed by UAVs. This paper transforms the minimum residence time into the shortest path combinatorial optimization, and discretizes heading angles. Graph theory is applied to analyze path problems and a global model with numerous constraint conditions can be built. Finally, a valuable reconnaissance path planning can be generated through solving the model with genetic algorithm. Also an application example that eight UAVs in four bases ﬁnish reconnaissance missions involving sixty-eight targets is established, and then an optimal solution is got to explain both the feasibility and efﬁciency of the proposed modularization and algorithm.},

We coin the abbreviation “MAGNET” to name the framework by stringing together the initials of the above six terms. The framework provides novel insights into analyzing various HAC patterns and integrates different types of HACSs in a unifying way. The presentation of the HACS framework is divided into two parts. This article, part I, presents the systematic analysis framework. Part II proposes a normalized two-stage top-level design procedure for designing an HACS from the perspective of MAGNET.},

	abstract = {One of the preeminent obstacles to scaling multi-agent reinforcement learning to large numbers of agents is assigning credit to individual agents’ actions. In this letter, we address this credit assignment problem with an approach that we call partial reward decoupling (PRD), which attempts to decompose large cooperative multi-agent RL problems into decoupled subproblems involving subsets of agents, thereby simplifying credit assignment. We empirically demonstrate that decomposing the RL problem using PRD in an actor-critic algorithm results in lower variance policy gradient estimates, which improves data efﬁciency, learning stability, and asymptotic performance across a wide array of multiagent RL tasks, compared to various other actor-critic approaches. Additionally, we relate our approach to counterfactual multi-agent policy gradient (COMA), a state-of-the-art MARL algorithm, and empirically show that our approach outperforms COMA by making better use of information in agents’ reward streams, and by enabling recent advances in advantage estimation to be used.},

We ﬁrst formulate a distributed solution based upon averaging algorithms that have been reported in the consensus literature. In this case, at each stage of execution a one-step sequential optimal control (i.e., näive greedy algorithm) is used. We propose a distributed stochastic optimal control algorithm that minimizes a mean–variance cost function for each stage, given that the probability distribution for possible node failures is known a priori, as well as a minimax version of the problem when the prior probability distribution is not known. We demonstrate via extensive numerical simulations that our proposed algorithm provides statistically better rendezvous task performance than contemporary algorithms in cases for which failures occur.},

Furthermore, these information exchanges are often performed over some open and resource-constrained communication networks, thereby making security and resource efﬁciency vitally important for various multi-agent coordinated control problems. This paper addresses a secure dynamic event-triggerbased resilient consensus control problem for an MAS in the presence of both sensor and actuator attacks. First, a distributed adaptive compensator is introduced for prediction of unavailable system states. Due to the existence of sensor and actuator attack signals, a secure dynamic event-triggered mechanism is then proposed, and a resilient control strategy is further devised for the paralyzed MAS. It is theoretically proved that the controlled MAS is asymptotically stable and asymptotic consensus is eventually achieved among the coordinated agents regardless of the attacks and constrained resources. Finally, three examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

	abstract = {A state consensus cooperative adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) control strategy is proposed for a nonlinear multi-agent system (MAS) with output constraints. On the basis of the transformation function, state models of leader and followers are transformed into afﬁne ones. By using a monotonically increasing mapping function, the state-consensus cooperative control problem for an MAS with output constraints is equivalently transformed into a cooperative approximately optimal control one for an afﬁne MAS. Then, a neural network observer is constructed for estimation of inner states, and, by graph theory and ADP method, the state consensus cooperative ADP control strategy is developed. The proposed strategy guarantees the performance index of the transformed system is approximately optimal. Furthermore, the stability analysis of whole closed-loop system is presented. Through the Lyapunov Theorem, we prove that the states of the MAS achieve consensus and the output signals of the followers satisfy the constraints. Also, all signals of the closed-loop MAS are bounded, and the trajectory of the leader node is cooperative bounded. The theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the strategy are veriﬁed by both a physical and a numerical example.},

We propose to create a shared agent-entity graph, where agents and environmental entities form vertices, and edges exist between the vertices which can communicate with each other. Agents learn to cooperate by exchanging messages along the edges of this graph. Our proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is invariant to the number of agents or entities present in the system as well as permutation invariance, both of which are desirable properties for any multi-agent system representation. We present state-of-the-art results on coverage, formation and line control tasks for multi-agent teams in a fully decentralized framework and further show that the learned policies quickly transfer to scenarios with different team sizes along with strong zero-shot generalization performance. This is an important step towards developing multi-agent teams which can be realistically deployed in the real world without assuming complete prior knowledge or instantaneous communication at unbounded distances.},

We ﬁnd clear evidence of six emergent phases in agent strategy in our environment, each of which creates a new pressure for the opposing team to adapt; for instance, agents learn to build multi-object shelters using moveable boxes which in turn leads to agents discovering that they can overcome obstacles using ramps. We further provide evidence that multi-agent competition may scale better with increasing environment complexity and leads to behavior that centers around far more human-relevant skills than other self-supervised reinforcement learning methods such as intrinsic motivation. Finally, we propose transfer and ﬁne-tuning as a way to quantitatively evaluate targeted capabilities, and we compare hide-and-seek agents to both intrinsic motivation and random initialization baselines in a suite of domain-speciﬁc intelligence tests.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the beneﬁts of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {The golden age of drone technology is upon us, and 2019 promises to build on the industry’s evolution and success over the past year.

Enterprise drone use increased by 58 percent from 2016 - 2017 — with the construction, mining, agriculture, surveying, and real estate sectors leading the way. That growth continued last year, and we expect even faster growth in 2019. For context, McKinsey predicts the economic impact of the commercial drone market will increase from \$1 billion in 2017 to over \$31 billion by 2026.

The bottom line is that drones are starting to become an indispensable part of our economic infrastructure. “We’ve seen drone adoption skyrocket across sectors, game-changing technology hit the market, and new partnerships form,” says Mike Winn, CEO and co-founder of Drone Deploy. “Drone technology is being used by the world’s largest industries, including construction, agriculture, mining, surveying, and real estate.”

While 2018 is in the rearview mirror, its momentum will bring us closer than ever to seeing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used on all kinds of job sites this year. Keep reading for our thoughts on where the industry is headed; how drone hardware and applications are increasing in sophistication; and how they make jobs safer, data more accurate, and workflows more efficient.},

As such it is important to understand the characteristics of networks with UAVs to enable the incorporation of multiple, coordinated aerial vehicles into the air trafﬁc in a reliable and safe manner. To this end, this survey reports the characteristics and requirements of UAV networks for envisioned civil applications over the period 2000–2015 from a communications and networking viewpoint. We survey and quantify quality-ofservice requirements, network-relevant mission parameters, data requirements, and the minimum data to be transmitted over the network. Furthermore, we elaborate on general networking related requirements such as connectivity, adaptability, safety, privacy, security, and scalability. We also report experimental results from many projects and investigate the suitability of existing communication technologies for supporting reliable aerial networking.},

The solution reported against this signiﬁcant threat to citizens safety is to consider careful planning and measures. Thereupon, in this paper, we address the crowd evacuation problem by suggesting an innovative technological solution, namely, the use of mobile robot agents. The contribution of the proposed evacuation system is twofold: (i) it proposes an accurate Cellular Automaton simulation model capable of assessing the human behavior during emergency situations and (ii) it takes advantage of the simulation output to provide sufﬁcient information to the mobile robotic guide, which in turn approaches and redirects a group of people towards a less congestive exit at a time. A custom-made mobile robotic platform was accordingly designed and developed. Last, the performance of the proposed robot guided evacuation model has been examined in real-world scenarios exhibiting signiﬁcant performance improvement during the crucial ﬁrst response time window.},

The model addresses the dynamic time-dependent transportation problem that needs to be solved repetitively at given time intervals during ongoing aid delivery. The model regenerates plans incorporating new requests for aid materials, new supplies and transportation means that become available during the current planning time horizon. The plan indicates the optimal mixed pick up and delivery schedules for vehicles within the considered planning time horizon as well as the optimal quantities and types of loads picked up and delivered on these routes.},

With regard to timely, cost-effective and very rich data acquisition, both, NEC Research as well as TNO are pursuing investigations into the use of UAVs and swarms of UAVs for scenarios where high-resolution requirements, prohibiting environments or tight time constraints render traditional approaches ineffective. In this review article, we provide a brief overview of safety and security-focused application areas that we identiﬁed as main targets for industrial and commercial projects, especially in the context of intelligent autonomous systems and autonomous/semi-autonomously operating swarms. We discuss a number of challenges related to the deployment of UAVs in general and to their deployment within the identiﬁed application areas in particular. As such, this article is meant to serve as a review and overview of the literature and the state-of-the-art, but also to offer an outlook over our possible (near-term) future work and the challenges that we will face there.},

	abstract = {Since unexpected natural disasters have been causing enormous losses all over the world, emergency management is receiving more and more attention recently. However, most existing studies generally focus on optimization models of speciﬁc activities instead of studying the system as a whole. Moreover, the performance of emergency management may be affected by various different factors and it is always difﬁcult for the practitioners to improve all aspects at the same time. In view of the constraint of resources, this paper brings forward an imperative issue on how to enhance emergency management by segmenting complex inﬂuencing factors into groups to improve them in a stepwise way. To address this concern involving the vagueness of human judgments, an effective method that combines fuzzy logic and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is used. Considering the interdependence among factors, this fuzzy DEMATEL method forms a structural model and then visualizes the causal relationships among factors through a cause-effect relationship diagram. Then according to the results of proposed method, critical success factor (CSF) of emergency management is ﬁgured out. Finally, 5 CSFs are identiﬁed out of 20 inﬂuencing factors, and all factors can be achieved in a stepwise way for better promoting the effectiveness and efﬁciency of emergency management.},

The next generation of wireless networks is expected to provide scalable, low-latency, ultra-reliable services empowered by the application of data-driven Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). The key enabling technologies of future wireless networks, such as intelligent metasurfaces, aerial networks, and AI at the edge, involve more than one agent which motivates the importance of multi-agent learning techniques. Furthermore, cooperation is central to establishing self-organizing, self-sustaining, and decentralized networks. In this context, this tutorial focuses on the role of DRL with an emphasis on deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for AI-enabled wireless networks. The ﬁrst part of this paper will present a clear overview of the mathematical frameworks for single-agent RL and MARL. The main idea of this work is to motivate the application of RL beyond the model-free perspective which was extensively adopted in recent years. Thus, we provide a selective description of RL algorithms such as Model-Based RL (MBRL) and cooperative MARL and we highlight their potential applications in future wireless networks. Finally, we overview the state-of-the-art of MARL in ﬁelds such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) networks, and cell-free massive MIMO, and identify promising future research directions. We expect this tutorial to stimulate more research endeavors to build scalable and decentralized systems based on MARL.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed signiﬁcant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered tremendous success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More speciﬁcally, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several signiﬁcant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-ﬁeld regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the ﬁeld on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging topic.},

With the recent development of (single-agent) deep RL, there is a resurgence of interests in developing new MARL algorithms, especially those that are backed by theoretical analysis. In this paper, we review some recent advances a sub-area of this topic: decentralized MARL with networked agents. Speciﬁcally, multiple agents perform sequential decision-making in a common environment, without the coordination of any central controller. Instead, the agents are allowed to exchange information with their neighbors over a communication network. Such a setting ﬁnds broad applications in the control and operation of robots, unmanned vehicles, mobile sensor networks, and smart grid. This review is built upon several our research endeavors in this direction, together with some progresses made by other researchers along the line. We hope this review to inspire the devotion of more research eﬀorts to this exciting yet challenging area.},

In this paper, we study the problem of networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where multiple agents perform reinforcement learning in a common environment, and are able to exchange information via a possibly time-varying communication network. In particular, we focus on a collaborative MARL setting where each agent has individual reward functions, and the objective of all the agents is to maximize the network-wide averaged long-term return. To this end, we propose a fully decentralized actor-critic algorithm that only relies on neighbor-to-neighbor communications among agents. To promote the use of the algorithm on practical control systems, we focus on the setting with continuous state and action spaces, and adopt the newly proposed expected policy gradient to reduce the variance of the gradient estimate. We provide convergence guarantees for the algorithm when linear function approximation is employed, and corroborate our theoretical results via simulations.},

In a such a distributed and highly dynamic system, a global coordination might not be possible. In this paper, we analyse static team afﬁliations, deﬁned at deployment time, and compare its efﬁciency against dynamic team afﬁliations generated during runtime using random selection. Since operators might not be able to determine all dynamic aspects of the given environment at the time of deployment, we further propose a novel, goal-aware approach to afﬁliate each robot with a team. This approach brings together insights from biology, sociology, and psychology. In this novel approach, robots only operate on aggregated information from the network which is potentially changing during runtime. Finally, we also introduce an approach to select a team afﬁliation during runtime using machine learning techniques. In 60,000 experiments we analyse the efﬁciency and further discuss the different beneﬁts and drawbacks of the proposed approaches.},

In particular, the observation of moving targets is an important multi-robot application that still exhibits numerous open challenges, including the effective coordination of the robots. This paper reviews control techniques for cooperative mobile robots monitoring multiple targets. The simultaneous movement of robots and targets makes this problem particularly interesting, and our review systematically addresses this cooperative multi-robot problem for the ﬁrst time. We classify and critically discuss the control techniques: Cooperative Multirobot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT), Cooperative Search, Acquisition, and Track (CSAT), Cooperative Tracking (CT) and Multi-robot Pursuit Evasion (MPE). We also identify the ﬁve major elements that characterize this problem, namely the coordination method, the environment, the target, the robot and its sensor(s). These elements are used to systematically analyze the control techniques. The majority of the studied work is based on simulation and lab studies, which may not accurately reﬂect real-world operational conditions. Importantly, while our systematic analysis is focused on multi-target observation, our proposed classiﬁcation is useful also for related multi-robot applications.},

	abstract = {In many real-world problems, a team of agents need to collaborate to maximize the common reward. Although existing works formulate this problem into a centralized learning with decentralized execution framework, which avoids the non-stationary problem in training, their decentralized execution paradigm limits the agents’ capability to coordinate. Inspired by the concept of correlated equilibrium, we propose to introduce a coordination signal to address this limitation, and theoretically show that following mild conditions, decentralized agents with the coordination signal can coordinate their individual policies as manipulated by a centralized controller. The idea of introducing coordination signal is to encapsulate coordinated strategies into the signals, and use the signals to instruct the collaboration in decentralized execution. To encourage agents to learn to exploit the coordination signal, we propose Signal Instructed Coordination (SIC), a novel coordination module that can be integrated with most existing MARL frameworks. SIC casts a common signal sampled from a pre-defined distribution to all agents, and introduces an information-theoretic regularization to facilitate the consistency between the observed signal and agents’ policies. Our experiments show that SIC consistently improves performance over well-recognized MARL models in both matrix games and a predator-prey game with high-dimensional strategy space.},

	abstract = {Recent advances have witnessed that value decomposedbased multi-agent reinforcement learning methods make an efﬁcient performance in coordination tasks. Most current methods assume that agents can make communication to assist decisions, which is impractical in some situations. In this paper, we propose a semi-communication method to enable agents can exchange information without communication. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a group concept to help agents learning a belief which is a type of consensus. With this consensus, adjacent agents tend to accomplish similar sub-tasks to achieve cooperation. We design a novel agent structure named Belief in Graph Clustering(BGC), composed of an agent characteristic module, a belief module, and a fusion module. To represent each agent characteristic, we use an MLP-based characteristic module to generate agent unique features. Inspired by the neighborhood cognitive consistency, we propose a group-based module to divide adjacent agents into a small group and minimize in-group agents’ beliefs to accomplish similar sub-tasks. Finally, we use a hypernetwork to merge these features and produce agent actions. To overcome the agent consistent problem brought by GAT, a split loss is introduced to distinguish different agents. Results reveal that the proposed method achieves a signiﬁcant improvement in the SMAC benchmark. Because of the group concept, our approach maintains excellent performance with an increase in the number of agents.},

	abstract = {Multi agent strategies in mixed cooperativecompetitive environments can be hard to craft by hand because each agent needs to coordinate with its teammates while competing with its opponents. Learning based algorithms are appealing but many scenarios require heterogeneous agent behavior for the team’s success and this increases the complexity of the learning algorithm. In this work, we develop a competitive multi agent environment called FortAttack in which two teams compete against each other. We corroborate that modeling agents with Graph Neural Networks and training them with Reinforcement Learning leads to the evolution of increasingly complex strategies for each team. We observe a natural emergence of heterogeneous behavior amongst homogeneous agents when such behavior can lead to the team’s success. Such heterogeneous behavior from homogeneous agents is appealing because any agent can replace the role of another agent at test time. Finally, we propose ensemble training, in which we utilize the evolved opponent strategies to train a single policy for friendly agents.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in video game AI, where the agents are located in a spatial grid-world environment and the number of agents varies both within and across episodes. The challenge is to ﬂexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration. Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations. To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication because of the large receptive ﬁeld provided by the stacked convolutional layers. Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others. The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II.},

Recently, Interaction Networks (INs) were proposed for the task of modeling multi-agent physical systems. One of the drawbacks of INs is scaling with the number of interactions in the system (typically quadratic or higher order in the number of agents). In this paper we introduce VAIN, a novel attentional architecture for multi-agent predictive modeling that scales linearly with the number of agents. We show that VAIN is effective for multiagent predictive modeling.

A distributed adaptive control protocol of minimal complexity is proposed that achieves prescribed, arbitrarily fast and accurate formation establishment as well as synchronization of the parameter estimates of all followers. The estimation and control laws are distributed in the sense that the control signal and the update laws are calculated based solely on local relative state information. Moreover, provided that the communication graph is strongly connected and contrary to the related works on multi-agent systems, the controllerimposed transient and steady state performance bounds are fully decoupled from: (i) the underlying graph topology, (ii) the control gains selection and (iii) the agents’ model uncertainties. Finally, extensive simulation studies on the attitude control of ﬂying spacecrafts clarify and verify the approach.},

An important contribution of this work is a method for quickly choosing the subspace, used for (3), to which each team’s problem is constrained. The heuristic is based on a tile-like pebble motion game, and returns true only if a subset of the environment will permit a solution to be found (otherwise it returns false).

	abstract = {Real-time artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications mapped on edge computing need to perform data capture, data processing/intelligence extraction, and device actuation within some given time bounds. Synchronization across devices is an important problem that needs to be solved at different stages of an AI application. Synchronized data capture reduces the amount of time required in preprocessing data (data aggregation, data cleaning, missing data handling, etc). In the data processing phase, synchronization is key in ensuring convergence, accuracy, and speed of the distributed training process across multiple edge devices. The actuation phase in some cases requires certain actions to be performed at the same time on different devices. In this article, we develop a fast edge-based synchronization scheme that can time-align the execution of input-output tasks as well compute tasks. The primary idea of the fast synchronizer is to cluster the devices into groups that remain closely synchronized in their task executions and statically determine synchronization points using a game-theoretic solver. The cluster of devices uses a late notiﬁcation protocol to select the best point among the precomputed synchronization points to reach a timealigned task execution as quickly as possible. We evaluate the performance of our synchronization scheme using trace-driven simulations, and we compare the performance with existing distributed synchronization schemes for real-time AI application tasks. We implement our synchronization scheme and compare its testing accuracy and training time with other parameter server synchronization frameworks.},

This research focuses on the role of internal factors in small- and medium-scale supply chains in developing countries, enhancing product completion time during the manufacturing process in fuzzy conditions. In the ﬁrst step of this research, a list of factors was found clustered into six main groups: technology, human resources, machinery, material, facility design, and social factors. In the next step, fuzzy weights of each group factor were determined by a fuzzy inference system to reﬂect the uncertainty of the factors in utilizing product completion time. Then, a hybrid fuzzy–TOPSIS-based heuristic is proposed to generate and select the best production alternative. The outcomes showed that the proposed method could generate and select the alternative with a 10.13\% lower product completion time. The ﬁndings also indicated that using the proposed fuzzy method will cause less minimum variance compared to the crisp mode.},

Considering a dense cellular network scenario that contains several NS over multiple base stations (BSs), it remains challenging to design a proper real-time inter-slice resource management strategy, so as to cope with frequent BS handover and satisfy the ﬂuctuations of distinct service requirements. In this paper, we propose to formulate this challenge as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem in which each BS represents an agent. Then, we leverage graph attention network (GAT) to strengthen the temporal and spatial cooperation between agents. Furthermore, we incorporate GAT into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and correspondingly design an intelligent real-time inter-slice resource management strategy. More specially, we testify the universal effectiveness of GAT for advancing DRL in the multi-agent system, by applying GAT on the top of both the value-based method deep Q-network (DQN) and a combination of policy-based and valuebased method advantage actor-critic (A2C). Finally, we verify the superiority of the GAT-based MARL algorithms through extensive simulations.},

	abstract = {Nowadays humanoid robots have generally made dramatic progress, which can form a coalition replacing human work in dangerous environments such as rescue, defense, exploration, etc. In contrast to other types of robots, humanoid robots’ similarity to human make them more suitable for performing such a wide range of tasks. Rescue applications for robots, especially for humanoid robots are exciting. In rescue operating conditions, tasks’ dependencies, tasks’ repetitive accomplishment requirements, robots’ energy consumption, and total tasks’ accomplishment time are key factors. This paper investigates a practical variant of the Multi-Robots Task Allocation (MRTA) problem for humanoid robots as multi-humanoid robots’ task allocation (MHTA) problem. In order to evaluate relevant aspects of the MHTA problem, we proposed a robust Multi-Objective MultiHumanoid Robots Task allocation (MO-MHTA) algorithm with four objectives, namely energy consumption, total tasks’ accomplishment time, robot’s idle time and fairness were optimized simultaneously in an evolutionary framework in MOMHTA, which address for the first time. MO-MHTA exhibits multi-objective properties in real-world applications for humanoid robots in two phases. In the first phase, the tasks are partitioned in a fair manner with a proposed constraint k-medoid (CKM) algorithm. In the second phase, a new non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with special genetic operators is applied. Evaluations based on extensive experiments on the newly proposed benchmark instances with three robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied. The proposed algorithm achieves favorable results in comparison to six other algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm can be seen as benchmark algorithms for real-world MO-MHTA instances.},

It is a general form of multi-agent coordination which includes a wide range of applications, e.g., rendezvous, alignment, formation and so on. This paper discusses a fundamental issue of this coordination: what kind of network topology enables us to achieve this coordination via distributed and relative control. We derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions of such network graphs, and show that the connectivity in terms of cliques (i.e., complete subgraphs) plays a crucial role. This result is a natural extension of the well-known result of the consensus control, and provides us with a uniﬁed control strategy for various coordination tasks. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the validity of the obtained analysis results.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of a production line is becoming more important with the development of demanding higher operational efficiency and safety in industrial system. However, a production line often operates under dynamically operational and environmental conditions and the production scheduling is also a very important factor for the maintenance of a production line. First, this paper proposes an integrated data-driven model that coordinates maintenance planning decisions with production scheduling decisions to solve the problem of scheduling and maintenance planning for a parallel-series production line. The degradation information is considered, and the total cost is to be minimized in the proposed model. Also, the total cost is related with production process and maintenance considering reliability of equipment. Then, in order to better describe the relationship between production and maintenance, the accumulative processing time of equipment is used as the input of its failure function. Also, an ability factor is developed to control its reduced level by adopting preventive maintenance. Finally, a case study is used to demonstrate the implementation and potential applications of the proposed model. The long-term wear test experiments are conducted at a research laboratory facility of Shanghai Pangyuan Machinery Co., Ltd. The result proves that the proposed method is feasible and efficient to solve the joint decision-making problem for a parallel-series production line with multivariety and small batch production. The proposed model in this paper is suitable for semiconductor manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian behavior is an omnipresent topic, but the underlying cognitive processes and the various inﬂuences on movement behavior are still not fully understood. Nonetheless, computational simulations that predict crowd behavior are essential for safety, economics, and transport. Contemporary approaches of pedestrian behavior modeling focus strongly on the movement aspects and seldom address the rich body of research from cognitive science. Similarly, general purpose cognitive architectures are not suitable for agents that can move in spatial domains because they do not consider the profound ﬁndings of pedestrian dynamics research. Thus, multi-agent simulations of crowd behavior that strongly incorporate both research domains have not yet been fully realized. Here, we propose the cognitive agent framework Spice. The framework provides an approach to structure pedestrian agent models by integrating concepts of pedestrian dynamics and cognition. Further, we provide a model that implements the framework. The model solves spatial sequential choice problems in sufﬁcient detail, including movement and cognition aspects. We apply the model in a computer simulation and validate the Spice approach by means of data from an uncontrolled ﬁeld study. The Spice framework is an important starting point for further research, as we believe that fostering interdisciplinary modeling approaches will be highly beneﬁcial to the ﬁeld of pedestrian dynamics.},

	abstract = {The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can signiﬁcantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a base station (BS) unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this article, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulﬁlling the energy demand. Second, a semidistributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers timevarying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11\% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4\% the energy cost (with 95.8\% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods.},

It is proved that the proposed control protocol ensures all the internal signals in the multi-agent system are bounded, and the follower agents track the leader exactly on the ﬁnite time interval [0, T ]; a sufﬁcient condition is obtained for the exactly consensus result of the multi-agent system by choosing the appropriate composite energy function. Extensions to the formation control of multi-agent systems are also given. In the end, illustrative examples are shown to verify the availability of the proposed AILC scheme.},

This emerging class of “physical networks” requires research into new methods of security that exploit their physical nature. This paper derives a theoretical framework for securing multi-agent consensus against the Sybil attack by using the physical properties of wireless transmissions. Our framework uses information extracted from the wireless channels to design a switching signal that stochastically excludes potentially untrustworthy transmissions from the consensus. Intuitively, this amounts to selectively ignoring incoming communications from untrustworthy agents, allowing for consensus to the true average to be recovered with high probability if initiated after a certain observation time T0 that we derive. This work is different from previous work in that it allows for arbitrary malicious node values and is insensitive to the initial topology of the network so long as a connected topology over legitimate nodes in the network is feasible. We show that our algorithm will recover consensus and the true graph over the system of legitimate agents with an error rate that vanishes exponentially with time.},

This paper presents a cooperative rescue framework by using wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs), where the objective of actors is to reach the event area with the aid of sensors. When an emergency event is detected, the sensor nodes will transmit an event report to inform the actors. Considered the actor mobility and duty cycle of sensor nodes, the data forwarding process from sensor nodes to mobile actors is described as an agent-based search. Then an improved ballooning strategy is proposed to control the search process. After actors receive the event report, a potential-based controller is proposed to make the actors reach the event area while avoiding collision between actors. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {A widely applied strategy for workload sharing is to equalize the workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multiagent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies whereby: 1) the environment is equitably divided into subregions of equal measure; 2) one agent is assigned to each subregion; and 3) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. The current lack of distributed algorithms for the computation of equitable partitions limits the applicability of equitable partitioning policies to limited-size multiagent systems operating in known, static environments. In this paper, ﬁrst we design provably correct and spatially distributed algorithms that allow a team of agents to compute a convex and equitable partition of a convex environment. Second, we discuss how these algorithms can be extended so that a team of agents can compute, in a spatially distributed fashion, convex and equitable partitions with additional features, e.g., equitable and median Voronoi diagrams. Finally, we discuss two application domains for our algorithms, namely dynamic vehicle routing for mobile robotic networks and wireless ad hoc networks. Through these examples, we show how one can couple the algorithms presented in this paper with equitable partitioning policies to make these amenable to distributed implementation. More in general, we illustrate a systematic approach to devise spatially distributed control policies for a large variety of multiagent coordination problems. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm and exploits the unique features of power diagrams.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential for military applications. Fully realizing the conceived benefits of AI requires effective interactions among Soldiers and computational agents in highly uncertain and unconstrained operational environments. Because AI can be complex and unpredictable, computational agents should support their human teammates by adapting their behavior to the human’s elected strategy for a given task, facilitating mutuallyadaptive behavior within the team. While some situations entail explicit and easy-to-understand human top-down strategies, more often than not, human strategies tend to be implicit, ad hoc, exploratory, and difficult to describe. In order to facilitate mutually-adaptive human-agent team behavior, computational teammates must identify, adapt, and modify their behaviors to support human strategies with little or no a priori experience. This challenge may be achieved by training learning agents with examples of successful group strategies. Therefore, this paper focuses on an algorithmic approach to extract group strategies from multi-agent teaming behaviors in a game-theoretic environment: predator-prey pursuit. Group strategies are illuminated with a new method inspired from Graph Theory. This method treats agents as vertices to generate a timeseries of group dynamics and analytically compares timeseries segments to identify group coordinated behaviors. Ultimately, this approach may lead to the design of agents that can recognize and fall in line with strategies implicitly adopted by human teammates. This work can provide a substantial advance to the field of humanagent teaming by facilitating natural interactions within heterogeneous teams.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of ad hoc teamwork, where a learning agent engages in a cooperative task with other (unknown) agents. The agent must effectively coordinate with the other agents towards completion of the intended task, not relying on any pre-deﬁned coordination strategy. We contribute a new perspective on the ad hoc teamwork problem and propose that, in general, the learning agent should not only identify (and coordinate with) the teammates’ strategy but also identify the task to be completed. In our approach to the ad hoc teamwork problem, we represent tasks as fully cooperative matrix games. Relying exclusively on observations of the behavior of the teammates, the learning agent must identify the task at hand (namely, the corresponding payoff function) from a set of possible tasks and adapt to the teammates’ behavior. Teammates are assumed to follow a boundedrationality best-response model and thus also adapt their behavior to that of the learning agent. We formalize the ad hoc teamwork problem as a sequential decision problem and propose two novel approaches to address it. In particular, we propose (i) the use of an online learning approach that considers the different tasks depending on their ability to predict the behavior of the teammate; and (ii) a decision-theoretic approach that models the ad hoc teamwork problem as a partially observable Markov decision problem. We provide theoretical bounds of the performance of both approaches and evaluate their performance in several domains of different complexity.},

These systems would be ready to be applied in different ﬁelds such as medicine, controller robots and social life. Reinforcement learning is an attractive area of machine learning which addresses these concerns. In large scales, learning performance of an agent can be improved by using hierarchical Reinforcement Learning techniques and temporary extended actions. The higher level of abstraction helps the learning agent approach lifelong learning goals. In this paper a new method is presented for discovering subgoal states and constructing useful skills. The method utilizes Ant System optimization algorithm to identify bottleneck edges, which act like bridges between different connected areas of the problem space. Using discovered subgoals, the agent creates temporal abstractions, which enable it to explore more effectively. Experimental Results show that the proposed method can signiﬁcantly improve the learning performance of the agent.},

	abstract = {Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary diﬃculty arises due to insuﬃcient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at diﬀerent temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for ﬂexible goal speciﬁcations, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an eﬃcient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2) the classic ATARI game ‘Montezuma’s Revenge’.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning learning algorithms. These structures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to ﬁnd metastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are deﬁned in terms of the transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. The skills are independent of the learning task and can be efﬁciently reused across a variety of tasks deﬁned over a common state space. Another major advantage of the approach is that it does not need a prior model of the MDP and can work well even when the MDPs are constructed from sampled trajectories. Finally, we present our attempts to extend the automated skills acquisition framework to complex tasks such as learning to play video games where we use deep learning techniques for representation learning to aid our spatio-temporal abstraction framework.},

	abstract = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning is efficient to deal with tasks that require cooperation among different individuals. And communication plays an important role to enhance the cooperation of agents in scalable and unstable environments. However, there are still many challenges because some information of communication may fail to facilitate cooperation or even have a negative effect. Thus, how to explore efficient information for the cooperation of agents is a critical issue to be solved. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with cognition differences and consistent representation (CDCR). The criteria of cognition differences are formulated to explore information possessed by different agents, to help each agent have a better understanding of others. We further train a cognition encoding network to obtain the global cognition consistent representation for each agent, then the representation is used to realize the cognitive consistency of the agent for the environment. To validate the effectiveness of the CDCR, we carry out experiments in Predator-Prey and StarCraft II environments. The results in Predator-Prey demonstrate that the proposed cognition differences can achieve effective communication among agents; the results in StarCraft II demonstrate that considering both cognition differences and consistent representation can increase the test win rate of the baseline algorithm by 29\% in the best case, and the ablation studies further demonstrate the positive roles played by the proposed strategies.},

	abstract = {While coalitional games with externalities model a variety of real-life scenarios of interest to computer science, they pose signiﬁcant game-theoretic and computational challenges. Speciﬁcally, key game-theoretic solution concepts—and the Shapley value in particular—can be extended to games with externalities in multiple, often orthogonal, ways. As for the computational challenges, while there exist two concise representations for coalitional games with externalities—called embedded MC-Nets and weighted MC-Nets—they allow the polynomial-time computation of only two of the six existing direct extensions of the Shapley values to games with externalities. In this article, inspired by the literature on endogenous coalition formation protocols, we propose to represent games with externalities in a way that mimic an intuitive process in which coalitions might form. To this end, we utilize Partition Decision Trees—rooted directed trees, where non-leaf nodes are labelled with agents’ names, leaf nodes are labelled with payoff vectors, and edges indicate membership of agents in coalitions. Interestingly, despite their apparent differences, the representation based on partition decision trees can be considered a subclass of embedded MC-Nets and weighted MC-Nets. The key advantage of this new representation is that it allows the polynomial-time computation of ﬁve out of six direct extensions of the Shapley value to games with externalities. In other words, by focusing on narrower Partition Decision Trees instead of wider embedded or weighted MC-Nets, a user is guaranteed to compute most extensions of the Shapley value in polynomial time.},

Agents can form coalitions to aggregate their skills, and achieve goals otherwise unachievable.

In addition to the conventional partition function game representation (P F G), we propose a number of new representations based on a new notion of externalities. In contrast to conventional game theory, our new concept is not related to the process by which the coalitions are formed, but rather to the effect that each coalition may have on the entire system and vice versa. We show that the new representations are fully expressive and, for many classes of games, more concise than the conventional P F G. Building upon these new representations, we propose a number of approaches to solve the coalition structure generation problem in systems with externalities. We show that, if externalities are characterised by various degrees of regularity, the new representations allow us to adapt coalition structure generation algorithms that were originally designed for domains with no externalities, so that they can be used when externalities are present. Finally, building upon [16] and [9], we present a uniﬁed method to solve the coalition structure generation problem in any system, with or without externalities, provided sufﬁcient information is available.},

	abstract = {The Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem plays an important role in the domain of coalition games. Its goal is to create coalitions of agents so that the global welfare is maximized. To date, Weighted Partial MaxSAT (WPM) encoding has shown high efficiency in solving the CSG problem, which encodes a set of constraints into Boolean propositional logic and employs an off-the-shelf WPM solver to find out the optimal solution. However, in existing WPM encodings, a number of redundant encodings are asserted. This results in additional calculations and correspondingly incurs performance penalty. Against this background, this paper presents an Improved Rule Relation-based WPM (I-RWPM) encoding for the CSG problem, which is expressed by a set of weighted rules in a concise representation scheme called Marginal Contribution net (MC-net). In order to effectively reduce the constraints imposed on encodings, we first identify a subset of rules in an MC-net, referred as a set of freelance rules. We prove that solving the problem made up of all freelance rules can be achieved with a straightforward means without any extra encodings. Thus the set of rules requiring to be encoded is downsized. Next, we improve the encoding of transitive relations among rules. To be specific, compared with the existing rule relation-based encoding that generates transitive relations universally among all rules, I-RWPM only considers the transitivity among rules with particular relationship. In this way, the number of constraints to be encoded can be further decreased. Experiments suggest that I-RWPM significantly outperforms other WPM encodings for solving the same set of problem instances.},

Given an undirected graph G = (N, E) and a valuation function v : 2N → R over the subsets of nodes, the problem is to ﬁnd a partition of N into connected subsets, that maximises the sum of the components’ values. This problem is generally NP–complete; in particular, it is hard for a deﬁned class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected members—that is, two nodes have no effect on each other’s marginal contribution to their vertex separator. Nonetheless, for all such functions we provide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general and minor free graphs. Our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for solving corresponding instances of the problem. Furthermore, we derive polynomial time bounds for acyclic, K2,3 and K4 minor free graphs. However, as we show, the problem remains NP–complete for planar graphs, and hence, for any Kk minor free graphs where k ≥ 5. Moreover, our hardness result holds for a particular subclass of valuation functions, termed edge sum, where the value of each subset of nodes is simply determined by the sum of given weights of the edges in the induced subgraph.},

	title = {Cooperative {Games} with {Overlapping} {Coalitions}: {Charting} the {Tractability} {Frontier}},
	abstract = {In many multiagent scenarios, agents distribute resources, such as time or energy, among several tasks. Having completed their tasks and generated proﬁts, task payoﬀs must be divided among the agents in some reasonable manner. Cooperative games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) are a recent framework proposed by Chalkiadakis et al. (2010), generalizing classic cooperative games to the case where agents may belong to more than one coalition. Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided proﬁts, some agents may feel dissatisﬁed with their share of the proﬁts, and would like to deviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a complicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight from some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it is possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators. This means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed coalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators. In this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core in OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is not empty, and whether a core payoﬀ division can be found in polynomial time; moreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial time algorithms. Finally, we introduce and study a natural class of OCF games, the Linear Bottleneck Games. Interestingly, we show that such games always have a non-empty core, even assuming a highly lenient reaction to deviations.},

We introduce the notion of link-convexity, under which the game is shown to have a non-empty core and the average tree solution lies in the core. In general, linkconvexity is weaker than convexity. For games with a cycle-free communication structure, link-convexity is even weaker than super-additivity.},

	abstract = {The Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is a promising approach for modeling distributed reasoning tasks that arise in multiagent systems. Unfortunately, existing methods for DCOP are not able to provide theoretical guarantees on global solution quality while allowing agents to operate asynchronously. We show how this failure can be remedied by allowing agents to make local decisions based on conservative cost estimates rather than relying on global certainty as previous approaches have done. This novel approach results in a polynomial-space algorithm for DCOP named Adopt that is guaranteed to ﬁnd the globally optimal solution while allowing agents to execute asynchronously and in parallel. Detailed experimental results show that on benchmark problems Adopt obtains speedups of several orders of magnitude over other approaches. Adopt can also perform bounded-error approximation—it has the ability to quickly ﬁnd approximate solutions and, unlike heuristic search methods, still maintain a theoretical guarantee on solution quality.},

However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Waste-to-Energy technology is a promising approach, that should help to mitigate risk of energy crisis and to overcome problem with increasing waste generation. The European union actively promotes energy recovery from waste in its policies and limits landfilling of utilizable waste. These legally induced changes substantially affect municipalities: waste treatment becomes more expensive and complex. To react to these up-coming complications, it is beneficial to create municipal unions, focused on the cooperation in waste management operations. Such municipal unions help to lower waste treatment costs and to optimize waste collection. This paper applies general cooperative game theory approach to study how municipalities cooperate within regions of intermediate urban-rural type. Novel distributed dynamic coalition formation algorithm is used to describe process of unions’ creation. Moreover, on the basis of sampling Shapley value, suitable financial transfers within unions are proposed. The paper also presents a review of current applications of game theory to energetics, validates proposed method using the Czech Republic interregional case study and discusses the conducted sensitivity analysis. Results suggest the most suitable municipal unions for adaptation to new waste treatment legislative and demonstrate that through cooperation municipalities are able to save up to 8\% of waste treatment costs.},

	abstract = {The current early-warning system and tsunami protection measures tend to fall short because they always underestimate the level of destruction, and it is difficult to predict the level of damage by a devastating tsunami on uncertain targets. As we know, the key to minimizing the total number of fatalities after a disaster is the deployment of search and rescue efforts in the first few hours. However, the resources available to the affected districts for emergency response may be limited. This study proposes two game theoretic models that are designed for search-and-rescue resource allocation. First, the interactions between a compounded disaster and a response agent in the affected district are modelled as a non-cooperative game, after which the risk value is derived for each district from the Nash equilibrium. The risk value represents the threat, vulnerability, and consequence of a specific disaster for the affected district. Second, the risk values for fifteen districts are collected for calculation of each district's Shapley value. Then an acceptable plan for resource deployment among all districts is made based on their expected marginal contribution. The model is verified in a simulation based upon 2011 tsunami data. The experimental results show the proposed approach to be more efficient than the proportional division of rescue resources, for dealing with compounded disaster, and is feasible as a method for planning the mobilization of resources and to improve relief efforts against devastating tsunamis.},

The achieved savings and reduction of the logistics costs should be used for investment in relief goods and therefore in saving more lives as well as serving more beneficiaries in disaster cases. Furthermore, the cooperation between different humanitarian organizations would ensure the transit time of the required delivery time of 24/48 h and significantly would reduce transport and logistics costs because of bundling synergies.},

            With different types and manifestations of polarization growing, it is crucial to understand their impact on welfare-promoting processes in society. This understanding is important when polarization interrupts both socially and individually optimal outcomes. We propose a model and framework to study and quantify the relationship between polarization and the ability to coordinate. We show, analytically, that some degree of diversity of opinions may be beneficial to coordination. Then, we explore, both computationally and through experiments, the role that properties of networks, namely segregation and biased perceptions, play in eroding coordination and moving societies away from the social optimum. We expect this work to provide the basis for upcoming research on the connection between the polarization of opinions and social outcomes.
          , 
            Polarization on various issues has increased in many Western democracies over the last decades, leading to divergent beliefs, preferences, and behaviors within societies. We develop a model to investigate the effects of polarization on the likelihood that a society will coordinate on a welfare-improving action in a context in which collective benefits are acquired only if enough individuals take that action. We examine the impacts of different manifestations of polarization: heterogeneity of preferences, segregation of the social network, and the interaction between the two. In this context, heterogeneity captures differential perceived benefits from coordinating, which can lead to different intentions and sensitivity regarding the intentions of others. Segregation of the social network can create a bottleneck in information flows about others’ preferences, as individuals may base their decisions only on their close neighbors. Additionally, heterogeneous preferences can be evenly distributed in the population or clustered in the local network, respectively reflecting or systematically departing from the views of the broader society. The model predicts that heterogeneity of preferences alone is innocuous and it can even be beneficial, while segregation can hamper coordination, mainly when local networks distort the distribution of valuations. We base these results on a multimethod approach including an online group experiment with 750 individuals. We randomize the range of valuations associated with different choice options and the information respondents have about others. The experimental results reinforce the idea that, even in a situation in which all could stand to gain from coordination, polarization can impede social progress.},

However, the CH4 ﬂow patterns embodied in global traded goods and services have not been interpreted from the perspective of a complex network. In this paper, we integrate global CH4 emission inventory from the EDGAR (the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research) databases, global multi-regional input-output model from the GTAP database, and complex network analysis to reveal the structural characteristics of the global CH4 ﬂow network (GCFN). In the GCFN, more than one quarter of the global anthropogenic CH4 emissions in 2014 are associated with international trade. The top 20 economies contribute to about 70\% of the total embodied CH4 emission ﬂows. The GCFNs mainly consist of tripartite patterns centered on China, the USA and Russia. Some emerging countries, such as Thailand and Brazil, also exhibit dominated positions in different kinds of GCFNs. Moreover, the core-periphery structure of the GCFN conﬁrms the existence of a few hub economies associated with a large amount of CH4 emissions. The results emphasize the multinational cooperation on global CH4 emission mitigation, and well-focused mitigation policies should be implemented on some key economies.},

A simple game can be viewed as a model of voting systems in which a single alternative, such as a bill or an amendment, is pitted against the status quo. An influence game is a cooperative game in which a team of players (or coalition) succeeds if it is able to convince sufficiently many agents to participate in a task. Furthermore, influence decision models allow to represent discrete system dynamics as graphs whose nodes are activated according to an influence spread model. It let us to depth in the social network analysis. All these concepts are applied to a wide variety of disciplines, such as social sciences, economics, marketing, cognitive sciences, political science, biology, computer science, among others. In this survey we present different advances in these topics, joint work with M. Serna. These advances include representations of simple games, the definition of influence games, and how to characterize different problems on influence games (measures, values, properties and problems for particular cases with respect to both the spread of influence and the structure of the graph). Moreover, we also present equivalent models to the simple games, the computation of satisfaction and power in collective decision-making models, and the definition of new centrality measures used for social network analysis. In addition, several interesting computational complexity results have been found.},

	abstract = {Purpose: An abundance of literature suggests that organisations adopting a cooperative approach achieve greater rewards than those that act in opposition or isolation. An emerging body of work also highlights the multiple actors involved in servitization. Despite this, in some contexts the benefits of servitization are not apparent. This paper examines business relationships in the oil industry and how they affect levels of servitization. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method study employing qualitative and quantitative methods was used to fully explore the context. In the quantitative phase, 48 oil industry specialists responded to a scenario based on game theory. This aimed to determine if the relationships between their respective organisations are cooperative or adversarial. Abduction drove a second qualitative phase. This consisted of a series of semi-structured interviews used to explore the servitization level and influence of servitization on relationships and vice versa. Findings: The statistical results suggest that all parties used adversarial strategies despite the publicised intent to work cooperatively. The interviews suggested that increasing (decreasing) servitization could increase (decrease) cooperation and, in turn, value co-creation but revealed nuances to this effect. It also adds to our understanding of the darker side of servitization by illustrating the impact of mimetic isomorphism. Originality/value: The findings add to understanding of the complex dynamics around servitization by showing that it is only at advanced levels of servitization that cooperative behaviour is observed, and base and intermediate levels result in non-cooperative behaviour and thus illustrate the importance of adopting a multi-actor lens to explore servitization.},

Several heuristics are used for attribution in practice; however, most do not have any formal justification. The main contribution in this work is to propose an axiomatic framework for attribution in online advertising. We show that the most common heuristics can be cast under the framework and illustrate how these may fail. We propose a novel attribution metric, which we refer to as counterfactual adjusted Shapley value (CASV), which inherits the desirable properties of the traditional Shapley value while overcoming its shortcomings in the online advertising context. We also propose a Markovian model for the user journey through the conversion funnel, in which ad actions may have disparate impacts at different stages. We use the Markovian model to compare our metric with commonly used metrics. Furthermore, under the Markovian model, we establish that the CASV metric coincides with an adjusted “unique-uniform” attribution scheme. This scheme is efficiently implementable and can be interpreted as a correction to the commonly used uniform attribution scheme. We supplement our theoretical developments with numerical experiments using a real-world large-scale data set.},

Augmenting systems are generalizations of antimatroids and systems of connected subgraphs in a graph. This fact means to relate two interesting structures in games. We study the core and the Weber set for games on augmenting systems. Later, two very known classical solutions for games are defined on augmenting systems: the Shapley value and the Banzhaf one.

Graph drawing algorithms are categorised into the following approaches: force-directed layouts, the use of dimension reduction in graph layout and computational improvements including multi-level techniques. Methods developed specifically for graph visualisation often make use of node-attributes and are categorised based on whether the attributes are used to introduce constraints to the layout, provide a clustered view or define an explicit representation in two-dimensional space. The similarities and distinctions between these techniques are examined and the aim is to provide a detailed assessment of currently available graph layout techniques, specifically how they can be used by visualisation practitioners, and to motivate further research in the area.},

The core philosophy underlying this volume is that abstract concepts are best learned when encountered first (and repeatedly) in concrete settings. Thus, the essential ideas of game theory are here presented in the context of actual games, real games much more complex and rich than the typical toy examples. All the fundamental ideas are here: Nash equilibria, backward induction, elementary probability, imperfect information, extensive and normal form, mixed and behavioral strategies. The active-learning, example-driven approach makes the text suitable for a course taught through problem solving. Students will be thoroughly engaged by the extensive classroom exercises, compelling homework problems and nearly sixty projects in the text. Also available are approximately eighty Java applets and three dozen Excel spreadsheets in which students can play games and organize information in order to acquire a gut feeling to help in the analysis of the games. Mathematical exploration is a deep form of play, that maxim is embodied in this book. 'Game Theory Through Examples' is a lively introduction to this appealing theory. Assuming only high school prerequisites makes the volume especially suitable for a liberal arts or general education spirit-of-mathematics course. It could also serve as the active-learning supplement to a more abstract text in an upper-division game theory course."--JSTOR website (viewed March 8, 2017)},

of the longest path. This implies that the schedule does not inuence the duration of
the project at all. In this paper we focus on projects related to building and construction industry, where the exibility in handling jobs is quite low. Thus, we assume that an activity
can not be performed until its scheduled starting time despite the previous activities have
nished earlier. In this case the schedule becomes fundamental to compute the duration
of a project.
We study two cases. In the  rst case only the assumption above is considerd. In the
second case we assume that every expedition of the activities over its scheduled time is

The Shapley value is always easy to compute. The core is easy to characterize when the game is convex, and is intractable (NP-complete) otherwise. Similar results are shown for the kernel, the nucleolus, the ε-core, and the bargaining set. As for the von Neumann-Morgenstern solution, we point out that its existence may not even be decidable. Many of these results generalize to the case in which the game is presented by a hypergraph with edges of size k {\textgreater} 2.},

We ﬁrst show that lexicographically minimizing the individual weighted excesses of players gives the same minimal weighted excess for every player. Moreover, we show that the associated payoﬀ vector is the corresponding least square value. Second, we show that minimizing the variance of the players’ weighted excesses on the preimputation set, again yields the corresponding least square value. Third, we show that these results give rise to lower and upper bounds for the core payoﬀ vectors and, using these bounds, we deﬁne the weighted super core as a polyhedron that contains the core. It turns out that the least square values can be seen as a center of this weighted super core, giving a third new characterization of the least square values. Finally, these lower and upper bounds for the core inspire us to introduce a new solution for cooperative TU games that has a strong similarity with the Shapley value.},

Then, we will associate to each player in a communication situation a weight in the interval [0, 1] that measures his bargaining ability. A unitary weight corresponds to a fully cooperative player whereas a null weight corresponds to a player that is not willing to cooperate in any way. Intermediate values modulate the bargaining ability. We modify the original TU-game to a new game which is, in turn, a modification of the Myerson’s graph-restricted game. We will assume that the reduction in the will to cooperate implies that players can not obtain the total dividend of the connected coalitions which must be discounted by an appropriate factor. Then, we propose as a solution for these situations the Shapley value (Shapley, in: Kuhn, Tucker (eds) Annals of mathematics studies, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1953) of the modified game. This solution extends the Myerson value (and also the Shapley value). Moreover it satisfies monotonicity in the weights. Different characterizations of this rule can be obtained. They are based on properties as bargaining component efficiency, fairness, balanced contributions and balanced bargaining ability contributions, and thus they are parallel to those more prominent existing in the literature for the Myerson value. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The methods come from time series analysis and artificial intelligence disciplines, and include univariate, multivariate, linear and nonlinear. Within the univariate methods, the double seasonal ARIMA and the recently proposed exponential smoothing for double seasonality are compared and used as benchmarks. They allow us to quantify the improvement on price forecasting when including explanatory variables or using more complex models. Dynamic regression models including the electricity load forecast are then considered. Their good performance in price forecasting has been pointed out by many authors. However, we find evidences of their predictive accuracy can be significantly outperformed by accounting the wind generation forecast provided by the System Operator. Moreover, these forecasts can be even more accurate if changes of price's behavior according with the day of the week are taken into account by means of periodic models. The last of the tested methods are feed-forward neural networks used as multivariate nonlinear regression methods with universal function approximation capabilities.

	abstract = {There is a wide range of papers in the literature about the explanation of machine learning models in which Shapley value is considered to measure the importance of the features in these models. We can distinguish between these which set their basis on the cooperative game theory principles, and these focused on fuzzy measures. It is important to mention that all of these approaches only provide a crisp value (or a fix point) to measure the importance of a feature in a specific model. The reason is that an aggregation process of the different marginal contributions produces a single output for each variable. Nevertheless, and because of the relations between features, we cannot distinguish the case in which we do not know all the features. To this aim, we propose a disaggregated model which allows the analysis of the importance of the features, regarding the available information. This new proposal can be viewed as a generalization of all previous measures found in literature providing a two dimensional graph which, in a very intuitive and visual way, provides this rich disaggregated information. This information may be aggregated with several aggregation functions with which obtain new measures to establish the importance of the features. Specifically, the aggregation by the sum results in the Shapley value. We also explain the characteristics of those graphics in different scenarios of the relations among features, to raise this useful information at a glance.},

This vector is used to build an interaction measure between the n elements of the set to which it refers. This interaction measure is represented by a Sugeno lambda-measure to which we make it being also a fuzzy measure. Then, we obtain the weighted graph associated with this new capacity measure. To carry on with it, we make use of the Shapley value. We also introduce the notion of extended vector fuzzy graph, which relates a graph with the capacity measure introduced in this work. Finally, we use a community detection method, based on Louvain algorithm, to search a cluster structure in the weighted graph. This partition is based on the relations among the individuals obtained from the initial vector. Let us note that in the case that there exist some connections among the elements, apart from their affinity, we can combine this extra information with that given by the vector, in order to obtain groups with highly-knit elements among which there are strong relations.},

In finance, ITS can describe the temporal evolution of the high and low prices of an asset throughout time. These price intervals are related to the concept of volatility and are worth considering in order to place buy or sell orders. This article reviews two approaches to forecast ITS. On the one hand, the first approach consists of using univariate or multivariate forecasting methods. The possible cointegrating relation between the high and low values is analyzed for multivariate models and the equivalence of the VAR models is shown for the minimum and the maximum time series, as well as for the center and radius time series. On the other hand, the second approach adapts classic forecasting methods to deal with ITS using interval arithmetic. These methods include exponential smoothing, the k-NN algorithm and the multilayer perceptron. The performance of these approaches is studied in two financial ITS. As a result, evidences of the predictability of the ITS are found, especially in the interval range. This fact opens a new path in volatility forecasting. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This information may represent, for example, how much some people agree with a specific law, or their position against several politicians. We emphasize the importance of being able to manage the vagueness which usually appears in real life because of the common use of linguistic terms. Then, we propose a constructive method to build fuzzy measures from fuzzy sets. These measures are the basis of a new representation model which combines the information of a network with that of fuzzy sets, specifically when it comes to linguistic terms. We propose a specific application of that model in terms of finding communities in a network with additional soft information. To do so, we propose an efficient algorithm and measure its performance by means of a benchmarking process, obtaining high-quality results. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the field of Machine Learning, there is a common point in almost all methodologies about measuring the importance of features in a model: estimating the value of a collection of them in several situations where different information sources (features) are available. To establish the value of the response feature, these techniques need to know the predictive ability of some features over others. We can distinguish two ways of performing this allocation. The first does not pay attention to the available information of known characteristics, assigning a random allocation value. The other option is to assume that the feasible values for the unknown features have to be any of the values observed in the sample (in the known part of the database), assuming that the values of the known features are correct. Despite its interest, there is a serious problem of overfitting in this approach, in situations in which there is a continuous feature: the values of a continuous feature are not likely to occur in any other, so there is a large loss of randomization (there will surely be an insignificant number of records for each possible value). In this scenario, it is probably unrealistic to assume a perfect estimation. Then, in this paper we propose a new methodology based on fuzzy measures which allows the analysis and consideration of the available information in known features, avoiding the problem of overfitting in the presence of continuous features. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This paper explores different approaches to aggregating color information from RGB and HSV images for edge extraction purposes through the usage of the Canny algorithm. The Berkeley’s image data set is used to evaluate the performance of the different aggregation methods. Precision, Recall and F-score are computed. Better performance of aggregations with HSV channels than with RGB’s was found. This article also shows that depending on the type of image used -RGB or HSV-, some methodologies are more appropriate than others.},

	abstract = {In this study, we approach the problem of polarization modeling with Markov Chains (PMMC). We propose a probabilistic model that provides an interesting approach to knowing what the probability for a specific attitudinal distribution is to get to an i.e. social, political, or affective Polarization. It also quantifies how many steps are needed to reach Polarization for that distribution. In this way, we can know how risky an attitudinal distribution is for reaching polarization in the near future. To do so, we establish some premises over which our model fits reality. Furthermore, we compare this probability with the polarization measure proposed by Esteban and Ray and the fuzzy polarization measure by Guevara et al. In this way, PMMC provides the opportunity to study in deep what is the performance of these polarization measures in specific conditions. We find that our model presents evidence that in fact, some distributions will presumably show higher risk than others even when the entire population holds the same attitude. In this sense, according to our model, we find that moderate/indecisive attitudes present a higher risk for polarization than extreme attitudes and should not be considered the same scenario despite the fact that the entire population maintains the same attitude. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Adding this type of information to the community detection problem makes it more realistic, as a community is more likely to be defined if the corresponding elements are willing to maintain a peaceful dialogue. The polarization capacity is modeled by a fuzzy measure based on the JDJ(pol) measure of polarization related to two poles. We also present an efficient algorithm for finding groups whose elements are no polarized. Hereafter, we work in a real case. It is a network obtained from Twitter, concerning the political position against the Spanish government taken by several influential users. We analyze how the partitions obtained change when some additional information related to how polarized that society is, is added to the problem.},

This new problem focuses on the dynamic process of the clustering rather than on the final picture of the clustering process. To address it, we introduce a new hierarchical clustering algorithm in networks, based on a new shortest path betweenness measure. To calculate it, the communication between each pair of nodes is weighed by the importance of the nodes that establish this communication. The weights or importance associated to each pair of nodes are calculated as the Shapley value of a game, named as the linear modularity game. This new measure, (the node-game shortest path betweenness measure), is used to obtain a hierarchical partition of the network by eliminating the link with the highest value. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we introduce several criteria that allow us to compare different dendrograms of a network from two point of view: modularity and homogeneity. Finally, we propose a faster algorithm based on a simplification of the node-game shortest path betweenness measure, whose order is quadratic on sparse networks. This fast version is competitive from a computational point of view with other hierarchical fast algorithms, and, in general, it provides better results.},

Staying in the class of two-person games with transferable unility, the article presents a more complete theory that expands their solution. Specifically, it presents: (1) a decomposition of a game into cooperative and competitive components, (2) an intuitive and computable closed-form formula for the solution, (3) an axiomatic justification of the solution, and (4) a generalization of the solution to games with private signals, along with an arbitration scheme that implements it. The objective is to restart research on cooperative solutions to strategic games and their applications.},

First, a summary of the seminal work is outlined, highlighting important contributions. Next, more recent results are described by employing a classiﬁcation based on the number of players: one-pursuer-one-evader, N-pursuers-one-evader, one-pursuerM-evaders, and N-pursuer-M-evader games. In each scenario, a brief summary of the literature is presented. Finally, two representative pursuit-evasion differential games are studied in detail: the two-cutters and fugitive ship differential game and the active target defense differential game. These problems provide two important applications and, more importantly, they give great insight into the realization of cooperation between friendly agents in order to form a team and defeat the adversary.},

	abstract = {In the general framework of multiplayer competitions Formula One classiﬁes as one of the most strategic sports due to the large number of decisions each driver must take and the huge impact these actions have on drivers performances as a whole. In this work we design and implement a fully characterized simulator for F1 races which aims to provide a mathematical explanation of drivers’ optimal strategies based on the rules of Game Theory. Results show how race outcomes commonly observed in real life can be explained in terms of drivers’ choices being the natural best joint strategies (Nash Equilibria) of a game of rational decision makers. Therefore, our implementation sets the basis for further developments in the framework of game theory as well as a tool to combine long-term and short-term decision strategies for each pilot while seeking the optimal set of choices to achieve the best possible results.},

	abstract = {Applying an optimal race strategy is a decisive factor in achieving the best possible result in a motorsport race. This mainly implies timing the pit stops perfectly and choosing the optimal tire compounds. Strategy engineers use race simulations to assess the effects of different strategic decisions (e.g., early vs. late pit stop) on the race result before and during a race. However, in reality, races rarely run as planned and are often decided by random events, for example, accidents that cause safety car phases. Besides, the course of a race is affected by many smaller probabilistic inﬂuences, for example, variability in the lap times. Consequently, these events and inﬂuences should be modeled within the race simulation if real races are to be simulated, and a robust race strategy is to be determined. Therefore, this paper presents how state of the art and new approaches can be combined to modeling the most important probabilistic inﬂuences on motorsport races—accidents and failures, full course yellow and safety car phases, the drivers’ starting performance, and variability in lap times and pit stop durations. The modeling is done using customized probability distributions as well as a novel “ghost” car approach, which allows the realistic consideration of the effect of safety cars within the race simulation. The interaction of all inﬂuences is evaluated based on the Monte Carlo method. The results demonstrate the validity of the models and show how Monte Carlo simulation enables assessing the robustness of race strategies. Knowing the robustness improves the basis for a reasonable determination of race strategies by strategy engineers.},

	abstract = {In circuit motorsport, race strategy helps to ﬁnish the race in the best possible position by optimally determining the pit stops. Depending on the racing series, pit stops are needed to replace worn-out tires, refuel the car, change drivers, or repair the car. Assuming a race without opponents and considering only tire degradation, the optimal race strategy can be determined by solving a quadratic optimization problem, as shown in the paper. In high-class motorsport, however, this simpliﬁed approach is not sufﬁcient. There, comprehensive race simulations are used to evaluate the outcome of different strategic options. The published race simulations require the user to specify the expected strategies of all race participants manually. In such simulations, it is therefore desirable to automate the strategy decisions, for better handling and greater realism. It is against this background that we present a virtual strategy engineer (VSE) based on two artiﬁcial neural networks. Since our research is focused on the Formula 1 racing series, the VSE decides whether a driver should make a pit stop and which tire compound to ﬁt. Its training is based on timing data of the six seasons from 2014 to 2019. The results show that the VSE makes reasonable decisions and reacts to the particular race situation. The integration of the VSE into a race simulation is presented, and the effects are analyzed in an example race.},

Second, we combine nonlinear programming techniques with convex optimization to numerically compute the optimal solution for an out-lap-ﬂying-lap sequence. Third, we devise equivalent lap time minimization strategies, whereby three PI controllers adapt the optimal control policy implemented on the car in real time, in order to track precomputed control strategies in a minimum-lap-time fashion. Finally, we benchmark the control algorithms presented against the optimal solution and validate their performance with high-ﬁdelity simulations.

There are several ways to inﬂuence the race with race strategy decisions, e.g. the timing of pit stops and the choice of tires. In order to be able to evaluate the race strategy before and to quickly adjust it during a race, a tool is required that simulates an entire race in a short time. For this purpose, the paper presents the methodology of a race simulation for circuit motorsports. It simulates races in dependency of various race strategy inputs and is based on a lap-wise discretization. It includes the effects of tire degradation, fuel mass loss, pit stops and overtaking maneuvers. The simulation parameters are chosen in such a way that they can be determined based on publicly accessible lap time data. The Formula 1 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is analyzed as an exemplary result. An application area is the support of race engineers in present motorsports. Future work aims towards the automation of strategy decisions in motorsports with autonomous racecars.},

	abstract = {El presente proyecto se realizó en colaboración con el CITSEM (Centro de Investigación en Tecnologías del Software y Sistemas Multimedia para la Sostenibilidad) durante el periodo comprendido de octubre de 2015 a enero de 2016. La motivación principal de esta pesquisa ha sido la provisión de una estructura lógica de tamaño reducido donde futuras aplicaciones puedan convivir en un sistema consciente. Aquí detallo la implementación de la arquitectura del conocimiento AROS (Arduino Robot Operating System) aplicada al robot cooperante Robinson. Ésta se basa en un sistema de comunicación mediante colas para resolver problemas como la traducción de direcciones lógicas a físicas, la coordinación de procesos o la asignación de recursos. Junto a la arquitectura cognitiva, se ha creado y utilizado el protocolo de comunicación ATP (AROS Transport Protocol) el cual soporta el transporte de mensajes entre aplicaciones de la arquitectura. En la descripción del protocolo que hago en esta memoria explico el porqué de su diseño y las restricciones de rendimiento de las que consta el tipo de comunicaciones para las que ha sido diseñado este protocolo. Como es el caso de todo desarrollo teórico, he requerido de una demostración práctica de aplicación tanto de la arquitectura como del protocolo de comunicación. Para esta demostración se ha implementado el control de diversos componentes periféricos además de las aplicaciones que hacen uso de ellos. Un ejemplo de uno de estos periféricos es el dispositivo inalámbrico utilizado como transmisor y receptor físico. Gracias a la plataforma de libre acceso de componentes electrónicos Arduino y a su producto Arduino Robot he sido capaz de obtener resultados de forma rápida empleando el lenguaje de programación C++ como soporte de lógica. Esto me ha posibilitado disponer de metodologías de programación como el "Equilibrado de Carga Basado en Colas" largamente utilizado en sistemas de alta demanda. Así, la culminación de esta investigación da pie a la evolución y mejora de esta versión de AROS para su uso en redes de dispositivos cooperantes donde las limitaciones de procesamiento, pobreza del medio de comunicaciones o almacenamiento son características del entorno de trabajo. ABSTRACT. This Project has been carried out in collaboration with CITSEM (The Software Technologies Research and Multimedia Systems Center for Sustainability) during the period of time compound between October of 2015 and January of 2016. The main motivation of this research has been building a logic structure of reduced dimensions on top of which future applications could live together in a conscious system. Here I give the implementation details for the cognitive architecture AROS (Arduino Robot Operating System) applied to the cooperative robot, Robinson. This is based in a queued communication system in other to solve problems like logical to physical address translation, process coordination or resource assignment. Alongside the cognitive architecture, it has been used and created the ATP (AROS Transport Protocol) protocol for communications, which supports the transport of message between the applications belonging to the architecture. In the protocol description that I wrote in this memory, I explain why I choose its design and the performance restrictions we have in the communications this protocol is aimed. Like any theoretical development, I required a practical demonstration of the application for the architecture as much as for the communication protocol. For this demonstration several peripheral component drivers and the applications that make use of them have been developed. One example for those peripheral components is the wireless device used as physical transmitter and receiver. I must give thanks to the open access hardware platform Arduino and to its Arduino Robot insomuch as I have been able to obtain results in a fast way making use of the C++ programming language as the logic support. This made possible to have available programming methodologies such as Queue-Base Load Leveling Pattern which is wide used in high demand systems. Hence, the culmination of this research leads to the evolution and improvement of this first version of AROS to be used in cooperative device networks where the limitations of performance, poor communications or storage are features of the working environment.},

	abstract = {Online news has been a hot topic since 2002 when the New York Times published its news RSS feed (Doree, 2007). At this time, users subscribed to the feed using their Netscape Navigator browser and received a daily update of the titles published in the newspaper. This feed was a service with no cost for the user and no monetary income for the journal. Nowadays, user engagement to services is one of the most profitable features for information companies, so they pay more attention to what they show to the users. To keep the user engaged, news aggregators offer their clients relevant information based on their interests. In the early days, companies asked the user the definitive source of the information he wanted to read to gather the user's preferences. Later, the aggregators ask the user about the kind and features of the information of interest. Still, most current systems do not ask for explicit information from the users but model their behavior from their navigation history. Recommendations arise on top of user's interest models, matching interests and news features. The intersection of both was first done by exact classification match and become fuzzier every moment till now where we have stickiness probabilities. Users and news featuring have walked a long path from its manual classification to the machine learning classification techniques used here, improving the user's recommendations. This study dives into the Microsoft News Dataset (Wu et al., 2020), analyzing the users' behavior in it. The main objective was to estimate the click gesture given the news clicked by users previously. This prediction is helpful for any news aggregator portal to show the most relevant news for the user's interest, saving time to the user, reducing the resources consumed by the portal, and, most importantly, improving its engagement score. Showing the users the most relevant news is a cold-start problem, where portals do not have enough collaborative information about news themselves before they become obsolete. News is a volatile asset, which dramatically depreciates as time passes. There is not enough time for an article to get relevant information from the users' community to profile collaborative filtering (CF) score. Therefore, this technique is excluded from the hypothesis explained hereabove. Instead, featuring engineering and featuring inference were used to predict the importance of a news article for a user.},

	abstract = {Cooperative game is a critical research area in the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Global reward game is a subclass of cooperative games, where all agents aim to maximize the global reward. Credit assignment is an important problem studied in the global reward game. Most of previous works stood by the view of non-cooperative-game theoretical framework with the shared reward approach, i.e., each agent being assigned a shared global reward directly. This, however, may give each agent an inaccurate reward on its contribution to the group, which could cause inefﬁcient learning. To deal with this problem, we i) introduce a cooperative-game theoretical framework called extended convex game (ECG) that is a superset of global reward game, and ii) propose a local reward approach called Shapley Q-value. Shapley Qvalue is able to distribute the global reward, reﬂecting each agent’s own contribution in contrast to the shared reward approach. Moreover, we derive an MARL algorithm called Shapley Q-value deep deterministic policy gradient (SQDDPG), using Shapley Q-value as the critic for each agent. We evaluate SQDDPG on Cooperative Navigation, Prey-andPredator and Trafﬁc Junction, compared with the state-of-theart algorithms, e.g., MADDPG, COMA, Independent DDPG and Independent A2C. In the experiments, SQDDPG shows a signiﬁcant improvement on the convergence rate. Finally, we plot Shapley Q-value and validate the property of fair credit assignment.},

It allows the impact of players’ interactions, rather than players’ contributions to inequality, to be taken into consideration. These innovative approaches are especially suited for the study of income inequality when the income has a hierarchical structure: the income is composed of several primary sources, with the particularity that each of them is also composed of secondary sources. We revisit the Shapley–Owen value that quantiﬁes the importance of each of these secondary sources in the overall income inequality. Our main contribution is to decompose this importance into two parts: the pure marginal contribution of the considered source and a weighted sum of pairwise interactions. We then provide an axiomatic characterization of each additive interaction decomposable (AID) coalitional value considered in this paper. We give an application of these decompositions in the context of inequality theory.},

Therefore, the distribution network operators consider billing consumers behind a common transformer in the function of their peak demand and leave it to the consumers to manage their collective costs. This management problem is, however, not trivial. In this paper, we consider a multi-agent residential smart grid system, where each agent has local renewable energy production and energy storage, and all agents are connected to a local transformer. The objective is to develop an optimal policy that minimizes the economic cost consisting of both the spot-market cost for each consumer and their collective peakpower cost. We propose to use a parametric Model Predictive Control (MPC)-scheme to approximate the optimal policy. The optimality of this policy is limited by its ﬁnite horizon and inaccurate forecasts of the local power production-consumption. A Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) method is deployed to adjust the MPC parameters and improve the policy. Our simulations show that the proposed MPC-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) method can effectively decrease the long-term economic cost for this smart grid problem.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an Energy Management (EM) strategy for residential microgrid systems using Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Shapley value. We construct a typical residential microgrid system that considers fluctuating spot-market prices, highly uncertain user demand and renewable generation, and collective peak power penalties. To optimize the benefits for all residential prosumers, the EM problem is formulated as a Cooperative Coalition Game (CCG). The objective is to first find an energy trading policy that reduces the collective economic cost (including spot-market cost and peakpower cost) of the residential coalition, and then to distribute the profits obtained through cooperation to all residents. An MPC-based RL approach, which compensates for the shortcomings of MPC and RL and benefits from the advantages of both, is proposed to reduce the monthly collective cost despite the system uncertainties. To determine the amount of monthly electricity bill each resident should pay, we transfer the cost distribution problem into a profit distribution problem. Then, the Shapley value approach is applied to equitably distribute the profits (i.e., cost savings) gained through cooperation to all residents based on the weighted average of their respective marginal contributions. Finally, simulations are performed on a three-household microgrid system located in Oslo, Norway, to validate the proposed strategy, where a real-world dataset of April 2020 is used. Simulation results show that the proposed MPC-based RL approach could effectively reduce the long-term economic cost by about 17.5\%, and the Shapley value method provides a solution for allocating the collective bills fairly.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RES) generating units such as wind power and photovoltaic (PV) units can be aggregated with controllable loads as virtual power plants (VPPs) to jointly participate in energy and regulation markets for extra market revenue. However, the uncertainty of RES limits the market performance of the VPP, which can be solved by energy storage. Due to the flexibility of the energy storage sharing mode, a two-part price-based leasing mechanism of shared energy storage (SES) considering market prices and battery degrada­ tion is proposed to provide the short-term use rights of energy storage for the VPP in a new pattern. Then, an SESassisted real-time output cooperation scheme for the VPP in joint energy and regulation markets is designed to improve the VPP market performance and a joint optimal market bidding model of the VPP with the assistance of the SES is developed to maximize the expected daily profit. Moreover, a profit allocation approach for the SESassisted VPP based on the improved Shapley value method and the minimizing deviation algorithm (ISV-MDA) is proposed to reflect the real contributions and balance the interests of its participants. Simulations based on data from PJM and NREL Dataset illustrate that RES can significantly improve their profits by participating in the VPP to jointly lease the use rights of SES and participate in joint energy and regulation markets through the coop­ eration and bidding strategies. In addition, the proposed profit allocation method is more reasonable and more targeted for allocating the cooperation profit than the cooperative game-based methods.},

	abstract = {Given the widespread adoption of renewable generation, storage and new loads like electric vehicle charging, there has been a growing effort to enhance local energy resilience, particularly at the community level. This has led to increasing interest in the development of local or community energy projects, in which individual prosumers are able to generate, store and trade energy within the community — enabling a shift in market power from large utility companies to individual prosumers. Such schemes often involve a group of consumers investing in community-owned asset such as community-owned wind turbines or shared battery storage. Yet, developing methods to enable efficient control and fair sharing of jointly-owned assets is a key open question, of both research and practical importance. In this paper, we provide a method inspired from game theory concepts to fairly redistribute the benefits from community owned energy-assets such as community wind turbines and storage. We propose a heuristic-based battery control algorithm for maximization of behind-themeter self-consumption, which considers the effect of battery life degradation. Using real consumption and production data to model a community of two hundred households, we assess and compare technical and economic benefits of investment in individually-owned or community-owned assets such as chemical storage. We show that battery storage simple pay-back period can be considerably reduced by sharing the asset within a community. Finally, we compare several redistribution and benefit allocation schemes for community-owned assets, and show that the proposed scheme based on principles from cooperative game theory achieves the fairest redistribution.},

	abstract = {Trigeneration systems, also known as Combined Heat, Cooling and Power (CHCP) systems, are interesting alternatives to supply different energy services in urban districts and in large buildings, particularly in warm areas such as Mediterranean countries. These systems can provide substantial beneﬁts from economic, energetic, and environmental viewpoints, since the cogenerated heat can be used for heating in winter as well as cooling in summer with an absorption refrigerator. This paper develops an optimization model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to determine the type, number and capacity of equipment in CHCP systems installed in the tertiary sector as well as to establish the optimal operation mode for the different plant components on an hour-by-hour basis throughout the year. The objective function to be minimized is the annual total cost. The optimization model considers the legal constraints imposed to feed the surplus autogenerated electricity into the grid at a regulated feed-in tariff. The optimization model is applied to design a system providing energy services for a hospital located in the city of Zaragoza (Spain). The effects of the ﬁnancial market conditions and energy prices in the optimal structure of the system are analyzed.},

	abstract = {The nucleolus offers a desirable payoff-sharing solution in cooperative games, thanks to its attractive properties. Although computing the nucleolus is very challenging, the Kohlberg criterion offers a method for verifying whether a solution is the nucleolus in relatively small games (number of players n at most 15). This approach becomes more challenging for larger games as the criterion involves possibly exponentially large collections of coalitions, with each collection being potentially exponentially large. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we develop an improved Kohlberg criterion that involves checking the `balancedness' of at most (n1) sets of coalitions. Second, we exploit these results and introduce a novel descent-based constructive algorithm to find the nucleolus efficiently. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithms by comparing them with existing methods over different types of games. Our contribution also includes the first open-source code for computing the nucleolus of moderately large games.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, we introduce a new solution concept for TU-games, the simpliﬁed modiﬁed nucleolus or the SM-nucleolus. It is based on the idea of the modiﬁed nucleolus (the modiclus) and takes into account both the constructive power and the blocking power of a coalition. The SM-nucleolus inherits this convenient property from the modiﬁed nucleolus, but it avoids its high computational complexity. We prove that the SM-nucleolus of an arbitrary n-person TU-game coincides with the prenucleolus of a certain n-person constant-sum game, which is constructed as the average of the game and its dual. Some properties of the new solution are discussed. We show that the SM-nucleolus coincides with the Shapley value for three-person games. However, this does not hold for general n-person cooperative TU-games. To conﬁrm this fact, a counter example is presented in the paper. On top of this, we give several examples that illustrate similarities and differences between the SM-nucleolus and well-known solution concepts for TU-games. Finally, the SMnucleolus is applied to the weighted voting games.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the demand for mobile wireless communication systems has increased drastically due to its significant use for various real-time applications. This increased demand for communication causes heavy utilization of the radio spectrum to improve ubiquitous computing services. However, systems providing high-speed communication fail to achieve the desired performance due to unsystematic spectrum utilization and resources. The problem addressed by Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) architecture has attracted research and industrial community to enhance the real-time communication systems. Although CRN based real-time communication systems suffer from resource allocation, spectrum sensing, and power consumption issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for resource allocation and sharing based on cooperative game theory, and cooperative node selection ensures maximized payoff. The proposed method optimizes the overhead, energy consumption, and resource utilization. Further, energy consumption and resource allocation issues transformed into an optimization problem. A backtracking search algorithm is applied to reduce the computation complexity and to find the optimal solution for resource utilization. The simulation result obtained achieves better performance compared to the existing energy-aware scheduling approach in CRN.},

This paper presents a three-level gameplaybased intelligent structure to evaluate individual and collaborative strategies of electricity manufacturers, considering network and physical constraints. At the Level I, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum power of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the power grid, to maximize the profits. Further, the fuzzy logic algorithm is applied to model the intermittent nature of the renewable sources and implement load demand in the power grid. At the Level II, DERs are classified into two different fuzzy logic groups to secure the fairness between every participant. Finally, at the Level III, the DERs in each group are combined each other by cooperative game theory-based algorithms to increase the coalition profits. Thereafter, Shapley, Nucleolus, and merge/split methods are applied to allocate a fair profit allocation by coalition formation. Ultimately, the results verify the proposed model influence electric players to find effective collaborative strategies under different conditions and environments.},

	abstract = {Logistics costs in general, and transportation costs in particular, represent a large fraction of the operating costs of many companies. One way to try to reduce these costs is through horizontal cooperation among shippers. Thus, when the transportation needs of two or more companies are merged, their collective transportation requirements can be met at lower cost. The attainable cost savings are due to economies of scale, which translate into cheaper rates due to increased negotiation power, use of larger vehicles and bundling of shipments. In this paper, a linear model is presented and used to study the cost savings that different companies may achieve when they merge their transportation requirements. On the one hand, solving this optimization model for different collaboration scenarios allows testing and quantifying the synergies among different potential partners, thus identifying the most proﬁtable collaboration opportunities. On the other, the problem of allocating the joint cost savings of the cooperation is tackled using cooperative game theory. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example in which different cooperative game solution concepts are compared. Extensive numerical experiments have also been carried out to gain insight into the properties of the corresponding cost savings game and the behavior of the different solution concepts.},

One of the important steps in this process is the fair division of payoff generated from such a joint effort among all coalition members. The nucleolus is widely recognized as a fair way of distributing the revenue in a coalition. While we have efﬁcient algorithms for computing the nucleolus using linear programming based techniques, we believe that such approaches are infeasible in multiagent settings where the loci of decision making is distributed among all agents in the system, and there is no central agent that can aggregate all data and compute for all agents. Towards this end, in this paper we present a distributed algorithm that computes the nucleolus-stable payoff division for any multiagent system modeled as a characteristic form game. We empirically show that our algorithm has many desirable properties - it searches only a small fraction of the solution space, evenly distributes the computational load among all agents, and executes reasonably quickly for this hard problem.},

	abstract = {The nucleolus is one of the most important solution concepts in cooperative game theory as a result of its attractive properties - it always exists (if the imputation is non-empty), is unique, and is always in the core (if the core is non-empty). However, computing the nucleolus is very challenging because it involves the lexicographical minimization of an exponentially large number of excess values. We present a method for computing the nucleoli of large games, including some structured games with more than 50 players, using nested linear programs (LP). Although different variations of the nested LP formulation have been documented in the literature, they have not been used for large games because of the large size and number of LPs involved. In addition, subtle issues such as how to deal with multiple optimal solutions and with tight constraint sets need to be resolved in each LP in order to formulate and solve the subsequent ones. Unfortunately, this technical issue has been largely overlooked in the literature. We treat these issues rigorously and provide a new nested LP formulation that is smaller in terms of the number of large LPs and their sizes. We provide numerical tests for several games, including the general ﬂow games, the coalitional skill games and the weighted voting games, with up to 100 players.},

	abstract = {In today’s networked world, resource providers and consumers are distributed globally and locally. However, with resource constraints, optimization is necessary to ensure the best possible usage of such scarce resources. Distributed linear programming (DisLP) problems allow collaborative agents to jointly maximize proﬁts (or minimize costs) with a linear objective function while conforming to several shared as well as local linear constraints. Since each agent’s share of the global constraints and the local constraints generally refer to its private limitations or capacities, serious privacy problems may arise if such information is revealed. While there have been some solutions proposed that allow secure computation of such problems, they typically rely on inefﬁcient protocols with enormous communication cost. In this paper, we present a secure and extremely efﬁcient protocol to solve DisLP problems where constraints are arbitrarily partitioned and no variable is shared between agents. In the entire protocol, each agent learns only a partial solution (about its variables), but learns nothing about the private input/output of other agents, assuming semi-honest behavior. We present a rigorous security proof and communication cost analysis for our protocol and experimentally validate the costs, demonstrating its robustness.},

However, although this approach has a variety of real-world applications (including social and organisational networks, biological networks and communication networks), its computational properties have not been widely studied. To date, the only practicable approach to compute Shapley value-based centrality has been via Monte Carlo simulations which are computationally expensive and not guaranteed to give an exact answer. Against this background, this paper presents the ﬁrst study of the computational aspects of the Shapley value for network centralities. Speciﬁcally, we develop exact analytical formulae for Shapley value-based centrality in both weighted and unweighted networks and develop eﬃcient (polynomial time) and exact algorithms based on them. We empirically evaluate these algorithms on two real-life examples (an infrastructure network representing the topology of the Western States Power Grid and a collaboration network from the ﬁeld of astrophysics) and demonstrate that they deliver signiﬁcant speedups over the Monte Carlo approach. For instance, in the case of unweighted networks our algorithms are able to return the exact solution about 1600 times faster than the Monte Carlo approximation, even if we allow for a generous 10\% error margin for the latter method.},

We formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to ﬁnd the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6\%) of the total coalition constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus. The proposed model and results nicely ﬁt systems operated by autonomous vehicles.},

This study addressed this research gap by proposing different contractual governances, based on a game-theoretic approach, for both manufacturer and retailer to better engage in JSD. Speciﬁcally, multiple JSD contractual arrangements regarding proﬁt and associated cost sharing between manufacturers and retailers were deﬁned and evaluated. Our analyses show that the manufacturer behaves opportunistically when the impact of a retailer’s effort on consumer demand is low. In other words, the retailer increases its sustainability effort, but not the manufacturer. However, such opportunistic behavior can be removed under a revenue sharing arrangement. That is, the manufacturer becomes cooperative with the retailer, and both retailer and manufacturer increase their JSD efforts. Several numerical experiments were conducted to assess the effectiveness of various revenue sharing arrangements (no sharing, partial proﬁt sharing, and total proﬁt sharing) in devising and implementing a mutually beneﬁcial JSD program. Accordingly, several guidelines for the SC JSD implementation are provided.},

	abstract = {China now faces severe air pollution problems while consuming a huge quantity of coal. At present, due to the emission charges and the emissions trading policy failed to effectively prompt enterprises to reduce emissions and improve air quality. Therefore, improving air quality through regional negotiations and cooperation may be feasible and effective. In this study, which was based on game theory, a transboundary air pollution model was established to conduct an empirical study on the cost-effectiveness of cooperative SO2 reduction in three cities of Hunan province in China. Four gain allocation mechanisms, i.e., the nucleolus, Nash-Harsanyi allocation solution, Shapley value and Separable Cost Remaining Beneﬁt (SCRB) principle, were employed to allocate the gains of cooperation, and the fairness and stability of the different allocation mechanisms were also analyzed. The results show that if a gain-sharing mechanism can reasonably allocate the gain from full cooperation, it is then feasible and effective for the three cities to fully cooperate to reduce SO2 emissions. Among the four gain allocation methods investigated in this empirical study, the stabilities of gain allocation for full cooperation using SCRB principle and Nash-Harsanyi allocation method were higher than those using the other two allocation methods. The results provide clear empirical evidence that regional gain allocation may affect the sustainability of cooperation. Therefore, although it was desirable to reduce SO2 emissions through cooperation, the long-term sustainability of cooperation should be taken into account in developing relevant policies.},

Our multidimensional coopetitive model suggests possible cooperative strategies in order to improve the efficiency and strength of the actions enforced by the countries to mitigate the Climate Change catastrophic risk at the level of its causes and effects.},

	abstract = {The motivation to protect environment and reduce CO2 emissions has resulted in increase in number of electric vehicle (EV) users. However, the rising number of EVs leads to increasing electricity demands and aggravates the burden on existing energy distribution systems. Therefore, the distributed energy systems, where consumers can also sell their surplus energy are required to overcome the potential challenges of high energy demands predicted in future. Furthermore, the consumers are now inclined towards buying energy from a renewable source to reduce environmental damage. Therefore, the sellers willing to contribute towards environmental sustainability also need to be encouraged to generate energy at a small scale through renewable sources and offer them at cheap prices. This paper proposes an energy trading system where both EVs and immobile users, such as houses and buildings, act as prosumers. They can buy or sell energy for both monetary incentives as well as for altruistic aim of environmental sustainability. A 5Genabled aggregator is proposed to manage the energy trading system through blockchain and smart contracts for maintaining security and immutability in transactions and verify energy sources. Stackelberg non-cooperative and cooperative games are formulated to strategize incentives of prosumers reflecting both altruism and monetary incentives. Complexity analysis and probabilistic calculations are performed to theoretically analyze the proposed system. Simulation results show more than 90\% and 60\% successful energy transactions when only seller is EV and when both buyers and sellers are EVs, respectively.},

This study proposes a crowdshipping model that consists of three stakeholders (the owner of a crowdshipping platform, crowdshippers and parcel providers) and with various incentives aims to maximise the proﬁtability of the platform and the compensation of crowdshippers, the quality of delivery, and to minimise environmental externalities. A two-level leader–follower game and the concept of Shapley value, from cooperative ﬂow games at the follower level, are used to deﬁne the optimal strategy that provides sustainable delivery with a good balance between costs and proﬁts. The game behaviour was explained on a crowdshipping platform provider (leader) and two coalitions: individual crowdshippers and parcel logistics providers. The aim of the example is to explain the strategy of promoting environmentally friendly parcel delivery. The results show satisfactory economic, social and environmental performance.},

            This paper proposes a central energy management system (EMS) in smart buildings. It is based on the coalition method for optimal energy sharing between smart buildings. Game theory is applied to obtain an optimal allocation of the building's surplus energy on the deficient energy buildings using the Shapley value, which enables the unequal energy distribution based on the energy demand. The main objective is reducing energy waste while preserving the generation/demand balance. The fog platform with memory storage is applied, which handles all the measured data from the smart buildings through Wi-Fi-based communication protocol and performs the EMS program. The smart meter links the smart buildings with the fog-based EMS central unit. Two scenarios are implemented based on the difference between total deficient and surplus energy. Coalition game theory is applied for optimal surplus energy allocation on deficient buildings when the total energy surplus is lower than the total energy deficient. Also, there is a one-to-one relationship between the surplus and deficient building; if the surplus energy is larger than the deficit, the extra surplus energy is stored for further usage. The proposed EMS is applied and tested using a smart city with 10 buildings in the MATLAB program. A comparison between the result obtained with and without applying the proposed method is performed. The performance of the fog platform is introduced based on the run and delay time and the memory size usage. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in a smart building.},

The methodology combines cooperative game theory with a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model allowing us to endogenize testing of stability of the global coalition and to include macroeconomic effects. Global cooperation is found to be stable only under mean or pessimistic assumptions about the development of key low-carbon power technologies and when damage is severe. If the technological development is favorable or climate damage is not severe, the gains from global cooperation are not sufficient to compensate for mitigation costs, because a nonglobal coalition of willing countries can then achieve emission reductions close to the global optimum. Finally, our findings support establishing nonglobal `climate clubs' to overcome the lack of global cooperation in international climate policy.},

	abstract = {CO2 emissions reduction is a global challenge while the associated cost pressure presents a crucial issue. Within a country, each region, with different levels of abatement cost, may play different roles to achieve the national target of CO2 emissions reduction. Such heterogeneity could play a role in the cost efficiency of national CO2 emissions reduction, i.e. the minimum total abatement cost across the entire country. Previous models pre­ dominately focus on minimizing the total abatement cost, while the allocation of cooperative benefits is largely overlooked. We constructed a combined regional optimization and game model, i.e., the cooperative emission reduction model. The aim is to achieve the national carbon reduction target while reducing CO2 emissions at a minimum cost through inter-regional cooperation. In order to achieve cooperation, it is imperative to ensure that every participating region can benefit from cooperation. This study developed a cooperative emission reduction model based on the Shapley value method of game theory to determine the mechanism to distribute cooperation benefits amongst participating regions in fairness. Compared to the total costs before applying this model, 17.04 \% {\textasciitilde} 33.62 \% and 19.59 \% {\textasciitilde} 24.62 \% total CO2 abatement costs of China can be saved in 2025 and 2030, respectively. This method can be employed in other countries to assist policymakers to establish an appropriate goal for CO2 emission reduction, and formulate a compensation mechanism to promote inter-regional cooper­ ation with fairness and minimum cost.},

	abstract = {Game theory provides useful insights into the way parties that share a scarce resource may plan their utilization of the resource under different situations. This review provides a brief and self-contained introduction to the theory of cooperative games. It can be used to get acquainted with the basics of cooperative games. Its goal is also to provide a basic introduction to this theory, in connection with a couple of surveys that analyze its use in the context of environmental problems and models. The main models (bargaining games, transfer utility and non transfer utility games) and issues and solutions are considered: bargaining solutions, single-value solutions like the Shapley value and the nucleolus, and multi-value solutions such as the core. The cooperative game theory (CGT) models that are reviewed in this paper favor solutions that include all possible players and ignore the strategic stages leading to coalition building. They focus on the possible results of the cooperation by answering questions such as: Which coalitions can be formed? And how can the coalitional gains be divided in order to secure a sustainable agreement? An important aspect associated with the solution concepts of CGT is the equitable and fair sharing of the cooperation gains.},

Agents may act cooperatively, building coalitions and acting according to the interest of the coalition, or they make their choices taking care of their individual interest only. We consider two kinds of countries: the ﬁrst type are industrially advanced, namely developed countries, while the second type are the less developed, namely developing countries. About environmental preservation, the developed countries are characterized by a higher measure of the environmental awareness than developing ones. We provide a new graphic way to visualise results about stable coalitions of different sizes taking into account several environmental awareness values. Moreover, we present a handy Maple algorithm to determine both the optimal costs for each country and the coalitions’ stability with an arbitrary number of developed and developing countries. Finally, we introduce an ex-post transfer scheme in order to expand a generic coalition to the grand coalition which reaches the greatest abatement level and the lowest aggregate costs.},

There is a need to develop a model that is stable and that provides evidence of an objective burden sharing rule so that the environmental agreement is more acceptable. This study approaches this problem via a cooperative game at the global level to make International Environmental Agreements (IEA) more stable. For this purpose, we apply the Shapley value transfer mechanism and find that under the commitment scenario, some regions attain the maximum benefits by joining the coalition. Shapley value transfer improves the coalition size and increases the global benefits at a certain level of abatement under perfect cooperation. Imperfect cooperation leads to lower levels of global benefits. Our findings offer new implications on how to improve the international cooperation for climate change. Commitments by major regions could activate the IEA (e.g., Paris agreement) efficiently. For the maximum global response to climate change, the national governments must reformulate and implement policies to meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The results of this study also help the national governments to set their implementation priorities to implement the Paris Accord at global level.},

Market failure occurs because of externalities, common property resources, and public goods. Environmental policy instruments include direct regulation, taxes/subsidies, tradable permits, deposit systems, voluntary agreements, and persuasion. Environmental policies usually focus on one pollutant or environmental issue but may have substantial impacts on other emissions and environmental problems. Neglecting these impacts will result in suboptimal policies. We present an integrated optimisation model for determining cost-effective strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions of several pollutants from several sources, allowing for interrelations between sources and abatement options. Our integrated approach in regard to acidifying compounds and greenhouse gases will be able to provide cost-effective policy options that will result in lower overall abatement costs. This paper shows that efficient emission reduction can be calculated, but we argue that, for transboundary air pollution and climate change, it is difficult to implement the socially optimal solution because strong incentives exist for “freeriding”. In order to implement efficient policies, international environmental agreements like the Gothenburg or the Kyoto Protocol are necessary to establish stable coalitions. The stability of these agreements depends on the distribution of costs and benefits over countries and on the redistribution of the gains of cooperation.},

The externality and timing effects are countervailing forces on abatement levels of greenhouse gases. The Paradox of Cooperation in the three-stage Stackelberg game is explained by showing that when the gains to cooperation are small the timing effect dominates the externality effect and large coalitions are stable. The timing effect has the greatest impact when the high benefit nations have low abatement cost. The cost-effectiveness effect arises from asymmetry and generates the need for an agreement with transfers. The cost-effectiveness effect is largest when the high benefit nations are high cost. This creates a larger difference in the marginal abatement cost of the last unit of abatement in the absence of an agreement. Numerical examples illustrate how the parameters and effects interact to result in outcomes ranging from no to full participation.},

We ﬁrst explain why the use of a technology oriented model may add value to the analysis of global GHG strategies. Based on the empirical ﬁnding of linear cumulative climate damages, the computation of Nash equilibrium can be reduced to solving a series of 15 independent linear programs, one per region. Moreover, assuming interregional transfers to share the global surplus of cooperation, our work adopts the point of view of dynamic partial equilibrium computation coupled with cooperative game-theoretic principles. The results illustrate how the non-cooperative strategy is closer to the base case than to the cooperative strategy, and the amount of side-payments sufﬁcient to guarantee the stability of the cooperative strategy are calculated with four different rules. The internal (in)stability of farsighted coalitions without transfers (non-cooperation) is also analyzed. The current project appears to be the ﬁrst one of the sort using a large and detailed technology explicit model such as MARKAL.},

When choosing models, people always expect to improve desirable outputs, while reducing undesirable outputs at the same time (e.g. when using a directional distance function model). However, directional distance function models may lead to biased estimations due to different directions given to different units. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose another non-radial efﬁciency evaluation model based on previous literature, which can also improve desirable outputs and reduce undesirable outputs. Then we employ this model to analyse the economic efﬁciency and CO2 emissions efﬁciency of the Asia Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation (APEC) members. Meanwhile, we also measure the efﬁciency change by using the Luenberger index, and analyse the reasons for efﬁciency changes from the perspectives of technical efﬁciency, and technical, changes. The results indicate that most countries have an extremely high economic efﬁciency, but relatively low CO2 emissions efﬁciency and integrated efﬁciency except for the United States, Japan, and Singapore. According to the Luenberger index, we ﬁnd an increase in integrated efﬁciency and CO2 emissions efﬁciency for most members from 2001 to 2010; however, technical progress is the main contributor. Technical efﬁciency exhibits a downward trend for most members.},

Our sharing scheme is particularly powerful for economic problems that are characterized by positive externalities from coalition formation and which therefore are likely to suffer from severe free-riding.},

	abstract = {In this paper a two-stage game of international environmental agreement formation with asymmetric countries is analytically solved. The equilibrium of the game makes it possible to determine the size and composition of a stable agreement. Two cases are studied. In the ﬁrst case, countries differ only in abatement costs, while in the second case, they differ in environmental damages. In both cases, two different institutional settings, one without transfers and another with transfers, are considered. The results establish that the asymmetry assumption has no important effects on the scope of cooperation in comparison with the symmetric case if transfers are not used or abatement costs represent the only difference among countries. However, when the only difference is in environmental damages, the level of cooperation that can be bought through a self-ﬁnanced transfer scheme increases with the degree of asymmetry.},

We propose transfers using both internal and external financial resources for making Bwelfare optimal agreements{\textasciicircum} self-enforcing. To illustrate the relevance of our transfer scheme, we use a stylized integrated assessment simulation model of climate change to show how appropriate transfers may induce almost all countries into signing a self-enforcing climate treaty.},

	abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of fuzzy measures index calculation. On the basis of fuzzy sets, Murofushi and Soneda proposed an interaction index to deal with the relations between two individuals. This index was later extended in a common framework by Grabisch. Both indices are fundamental in the literature of fuzzy measures. Nevertheless, the corresponding calculation still presents a highly complex problem for which no approximation solution has been proposed yet. Then, using a representation of the Shapley based on orders, here we suggest an alternative calculation of the interaction index, both for the simple case of pairs of individuals, and for the more complex situation in which any set could be considered. This alternative representation facilitates the handling of these indices. Moreover, we draw on this representation to deﬁne two polynomial methods based on sampling to estimate the interaction index, as well as a method to approximate the generalized version of it. We provide some computational results to test the goodness of the proposed algorithms.},
