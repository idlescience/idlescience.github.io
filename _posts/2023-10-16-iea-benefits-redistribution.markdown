International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) provide a framework for countries to collectively address environmental challenges such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. A crucial aspect ensuring the stability and effectiveness of such coalitions is the equitable distribution of benefits derived from joint emission reduction efforts. Disparities among nations in terms of emissions levels, economic capacities, and cost-benefit analyses pose obstacles to fair benefit sharing.

In light of these challenges, establishing a mechanism for benefit redistribution that is perceived as fair and just by all member nations is imperative. Such a mechanism would not only incentivize nations to join and adhere to the coalition but also foster a sense of trust and mutual benefit among them. This study delves into one such proposed mechanism, diving into cooperative game theory to explore how benefits can be equitably redistributed among nations in a way that reflects their individual contributions and sustains the coalition's integrity in the long term. Through the insights offered by McGinty (2020), this discourse aims to illuminate the path towards more stable and effective International Environmental Agreements.

## Problem Statement

To ensure the long-term stability of a coalition of signatories to an environmental cooperation treaty, there must be a mechanism for transfer between countries that allows for the redistribution of benefits derived from their collective efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

By setting up this mechanism based on the distribution proposed by Shapley (1953b), each country would receive a share proportional to its contribution to all possible sub-coalitions within the broader coalition.

## Mathematical Solution

To compute the Shapley value, it's essential to define the expressions that describe the benefit calculation of a coalition in this cooperative game. McGinty (2020) characterized a country's net benefit as the difference between the gross benefit from the total emissions reduction for that country, $$B_{i}(Q)$$ , and the individual cost of that country, $$C_{i}(q_{i})$$, in reducing an amount $$q_{i}$$ of GHG emissions.

$$\pi_{i}(\alpha_{i}, c_{i}, q_{i}, Q) = b\alpha_{i}\left(aQ-\frac{Q^{2}}{2}\right) - \frac{c_{i}(q_{i})^{2}}{2}$$

Here, $$b$$ and $$a$$ are strictly greater than zero, $$\alpha_{i}$$ is country $$i$$'s share in the global benefit of emissions reduction, and  $$c_{i}$$ is the marginal cost of reducing one unit of emissions for country $$i$$.

The value that a coalition $$S$$ obtains is the sum of the net benefits of the countries that are part of said coalition, which have made a joint effort to reduce emissions by an optimal amount $$Q_{S}$$.

The global emissions reduction $$Q$$ is the amalgam of the optimal emissions reduction for the signatory members of the coalition and the reduction from non-signatory members $$T = N \setminus S$$.

$$Q = \frac{ab\left(\sum{j \in T}{\theta_{j}} + \sum{i \in S}{\frac{1}{c_{i}}} + \sum{i \in S}{\alpha_{i}}\right)}{1+b\left(\sum{j \in T}{\theta_{j}} + \sum{i \in S}{\frac{1}{c_{i}}} + \sum{i \in S}{\alpha_{i}}\right)}$$

Where $$\theta_{j} = \frac{\alpha_{j}}{c_{j}}$$​​ is the ratio between player $$j$$'s share $$\alpha_{j}$$ in the global benefit and their marginal cost of emissions reduction $$c_{j}$$.
