In recent times, the threat posed by environmental degradation has garnered widespread attention, propelling nations to unite and formulate strategies to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Among such strategies are International Environmental Agreements (IEAs) that serve as platforms for countries to collaborate in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a prime contributor to climate change. These agreements entail collective action where member nations pledge to undertake certain measures aimed at curbing emissions. However, the path to formulating and maintaining a stable coalition is fraught with challenges, central among them being the equitable distribution of benefits accrued from joint emission reduction efforts.

The crux of the problem lies in the inherent disparities among nations—varying levels of emissions, differing economic capacities, and diverse cost-benefit analyses. When nations come together to form a coalition, each brings to the table its unique strengths and abilities to combat emissions. The collective action undoubtedly generates benefits, such as reduced global emissions, enhanced ecological sustainability, and often, economic gains from collaborative projects or trading emission permits. Yet, the pivotal question remains: how should these benefits be distributed among the member nations to reflect their individual contributions and incurred costs accurately?

The answer to this conundrum is critical as it bears directly on the willingness of nations to participate and remain committed to the coalition. An unfair distribution could lead to discontent and eventual disintegration of the coalition, defeating the overarching goal of environmental preservation. Moreover, the fear of free-riding—nations reaping benefits without contributing equitably—further complicates the scenario.

In light of these challenges, establishing a mechanism for benefit redistribution that is perceived as fair and just by all member nations is imperative. Such a mechanism would not only incentivize nations to join and adhere to the coalition but also foster a sense of trust and mutual benefit among them. This study delves into one such proposed mechanism, drawing on cooperative game theory to explore how benefits can be equitably redistributed among nations in a way that reflects their individual contributions and sustains the coalition's integrity in the long term. Through a meticulous examination of the Shapley value and the insights offered by McGinty (2020), this discourse aims to illuminate the path towards more stable and effective International Environmental Agreements.

## Problem Statement

To ensure the long-term stability of a coalition of signatories to an environmental cooperation treaty, there must be a mechanism for transfer between countries that allows for the redistribution of benefits derived from their collective efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

By setting up this mechanism based on the distribution proposed by Shapley (1953b), each country would receive a share proportional to its contribution to all possible sub-coalitions within the broader coalition.

## Mathematical Solution

To compute the Shapley value, it's essential to define the expressions that describe the benefit calculation of a coalition in this cooperative game. McGinty (2020) characterized a country's net benefit as the difference between the gross benefit from the total emissions reduction for that country, $$B_{i}(Q)$$ , and the individual cost of that country, $$C_{i}(q_{i})$$, in reducing an amount $$q_{i}$$ of GHG emissions.

$$\pi_{i}(\alpha_{i}, c_{i}, q_{i}, Q) = b\alpha_{i}\left(aQ-\frac{Q^{2}}{2}\right) - \frac{c_{i}(q_{i})^{2}}{2}$$

Here, $$b$$ and $$a$$ are strictly greater than zero, $$\alpha_{i}$$ is country $$i$$'s share in the global benefit of emissions reduction, and  $$c_{i}$$ is the marginal cost of reducing one unit of emissions for country $$i$$.

The value that a coalition $$S$$ obtains is the sum of the net benefits of the countries that are part of said coalition, which have made a joint effort to reduce emissions by an optimal amount $$Q_{S}$$.

The global emissions reduction $$Q$$ is the amalgam of the optimal emissions reduction for the signatory members of the coalition and the reduction from non-signatory members $$T = N \setminus S$$.

$$Q = \frac{ab\left(\sum{j \in T}{\theta_{j}} + \sum{i \in S}{\frac{1}{c_{i}}} + \sum{i \in S}{\alpha_{i}}\right)}{1+b\left(\sum{j \in T}{\theta_{j}} + \sum{i \in S}{\frac{1}{c_{i}}} + \sum{i \in S}{\alpha_{i}}\right)}$$

Where $$\theta_{j} = \frac{\alpha_{j}}{c_{j}}$$​​ is the ratio between player $$j$$'s share $$\alpha_{j}$$ in the global benefit and their marginal cost of emissions reduction $$c_{j}$$.
