Formula 1, a high-speed racing event, is not just about the competition on the track; it **involves intricate interactions between stakeholders, ranging from drivers, teams, and manufacturers**, to sponsors, media, and fans. These interactions can be aptly analyzed using the lens of game theory, specifically the concept of the nucleolus solution.

### Introduction {#introduction}

Formula 1 is one of the most popular sports worldwide, engaging millions of fans, generating massive revenues, and showcasing technological marvels. The business side of Formula 1 involves a complex web of relationships and negotiations, each with their set of challenges and complexities. These can be addressed using cooperative game theory, specifically the nucleolus solution.

### Game Theory and the Nucleolus {#game-theory-and-the-nucleolus}

Game theory provides frameworks for predicting behavior in situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple parties, each trying to maximize their gain. The nucleolus is one such solution concept in cooperative game theory.

The nucleolus was introduced by Schmeidler (1969) as a method to ensure equity in distribution, focusing on minimizing the dissatisfaction of the most dissatisfied player. By doing this, the nucleolus aims to achieve a balance where no coalition can improve the situation of its members without making at least one member of another coalition worse off.

### Nucleolus Application in Formula 1 {#nucleolus-application-in-formula-1}

A tangible use case in Formula 1 is the distribution of television broadcast revenues among the racing teams.

Consider a situation where different F1 teams (say, Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari) are negotiating for a share of television revenue. Each team brings a unique value to the sport - be it in terms of performance, fan base, or history in the sport. All teams want a significant share, but there is a fixed amount of revenue.

Using the nucleolus solution, we aim to distribute the revenue in such a way that no coalition of teams can argue that they're collectively disadvantaged.

The first step involves identifying the coalitions and their worth, i.e., how much revenue they could collectively negotiate based on their combined value. Once these values are determined, dissatisfaction can be calculated for all possible coalitions, with the aim of minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction.

### Game Deifnition

First, we must enumerate F1 teams as player of a Cooperative Game. We will define Ferrari as _player 1_, Mercedes as _player 2_, Red Bull as _player 3_, Alpine as _player 4_, McLaren as _player 5_, Aston Martin as _player 6_, Alpha Tauri as _player 7_, Haas as _player 8_, Williams as _player 9_, and Sauber as _player 10_.

Afterwards, we must define the characteristic payoff for the posible colaitions in the game. If it is a full game, then we need to define a value for de $$2^n - 1$$ posible coalitions, knowing that the number of players $$n = 10$$ in this case. The minus 1 scenario belongs to the empty game $$v({\varnothing})$$ that is always $$0$$.

### Benefits of Applying the Nucleolus Solution {#benefits-of-applying-the-nucleolus-solution}

Application of the nucleolus solution to such a situation ensures fairness in the distribution of revenues. It maintains a balanced competitive environment and avoids the formation of discontented coalitions that might destabilize the sport. This application of game theory to real-world business situations offers a novel way to address complexities, ensuring stability and fairness.

### Conclusion {#conclusion}

While the application of the nucleolus solution in Formula 1 may be theoretical, it provides a unique perspective on handling the sport's business aspect. By understanding and considering the dynamics of the sport as a cooperative game, stakeholders can navigate challenges and strike balance and fairness in negotiations and revenue distribution.

Game theory, and the nucleolus solution in particular, provides a mathematical and scientific approach to problem-solving in Formula 1's business sphere, driving a fairer and more balanced future for the sport.
